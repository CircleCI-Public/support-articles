Objective

It is possible while we have a specific version of Python installed on our Windows Executor, your builds require something different instead.

 

Solution

If the version that you are looking for is not installed, you can try the following command:

 

- run: choco install python --version={{python version}} --force -y  /norestart
 

If the version of python is  installed on the executor, but just needs to be referenced, you can use the following (using Python 3.9 as an example):

- run:
    name: installed version verification
    shell: bash
    command: |
      py -3.9 -m venv venv39
      source ./venv39/Scripts/activate
      python --version
 

You should now be able to run the requested Python versions in your Windows Builds.
