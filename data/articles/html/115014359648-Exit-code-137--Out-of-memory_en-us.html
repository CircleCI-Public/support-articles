<p>This is a Linux error code which you may see on CircleCI when your container runs out of memory. Containers are given 4GB of RAM by default. If your build process consumes all of the container memory, your build will fail.</p>
<p>For memory issues related to builds that are using <strong>Java</strong>, please see <a href="https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-handle-java-oom-errors/" target="_self">this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>If your jobs are using <strong>Android</strong>, please reference our FAQ on <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021812453" target="_self">Common Android Memory Issues</a> for tips on limiting memory usage. </p>
<p>With the <a href="https://circleci.com/pricing/usage/" target="_self">Performance Plan</a>, you can use the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource_class" target="_self"><em>resource_class</em></a> configuration option to control the available resources for your build containers. </p>
<p>Sometimes tools that automatically spawn workers, processes, or threads based on CPU count can inadvertently cause memory issues on CircleCI, and require manual config when running in the CI environment.
