<p>Networking issues can stop your job from succeeding.<br>You may want to mitigate this issue by implementing a for-loop to retry the failing step until it succeeds with a non-zero exit code or exhausts all retries.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HH3G8WPBZGN3E0ZT5RBZJMTT">For-Loop Example and Explanation</h2>
<p>An example command can be found below:</p>
<pre dir="ltr"><code>- run: |<br>    N=5<br>    while [ $N -gt 0 ]<br>    do<br>      if $(docker-compose up -d); then <br>        echo "Spun up services via Docker Compose"<br>        exit 0<br>      fi<br><br>      echo "Failed to spin up services. Retrying..."<br>      N=$(( $N - 1 ))<br>      sleep 10<br>    done<br>    exit 1</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the main command is <code>docker-compose up -d</code>.</p>
<p>We are looping to retry for up to 5 more times if the command fails (exit non-zero).<br>Here, we <strong>assume</strong> it is safe to retry when we receive a non-zero exit.<br>If the command in question has any side-effects, it may not be best to retry them.</p>
<p>You can replace the <code>sleep 10</code> with any wait time preferred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br>Please be aware that this can increase the overall duration of the step.<br>The credits consumed for this job may be increased as such.<br>Do consider this impact when implementing this approach.</p>
