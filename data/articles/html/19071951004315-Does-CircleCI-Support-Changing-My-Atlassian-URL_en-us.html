<p>As found here in <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CLOUD-10809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the linked CLOUD-10809 issue</a>, we do not support this as we are not on the list as a vendor who is compatible with such changes. We do not have additional details about what impact can be expected when changing an Atlassian URL for a project. It is possible that you may lose all data from before the URL was changed.<br> <br>We recommend staying up to date on any updates that may be posted about the JIRA orb in our CircleCI Discuss forum announcements:</p>
