<p>For scenarios where you are using the <a href="https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/slack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack orb</a> and want to send a notification if a workflow itself has been successful or failed -- you would need to implement a notification per job.</p>
<p>For workflows that run sequentially, you can anchor the Slack notification and apply the anchor to each of the jobs in the workflow via <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#pre-steps-and-post-steps-requires-version-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-steps</a> -- except the last job that is run. For that job, you would set it to the standard <code>slack/notify</code> to catch both successes and failures. Below is an example of how this may look with Slack orb version below <code>4.0.0</code>:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">version: 2.1

slack-fail-post-step: &amp;slack-fail-post-step
  post-steps:
    - slack/status:
        fail_only: true

orbs:
  slack: circleci/slack@3.4.2

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
      
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Success
          command: |
            exit 0
  last-job:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
      
    steps:
      - run:
          name: Success
          command: |
            exit 0
  
workflows:
  version: 2
  workflow:
    jobs:
      - build: *slack-fail-post-step
      - last-job:
          requires:
            - build
          post-steps:
            - slack/status</pre>
<p>However if your workflow jobs don't run sequentially, you will need to create a new job that contains the slack notification and <code>require</code> that the job has run all the previous jobs.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of how you could set this up if you use the Slack orb version <code>4.0.0</code> or above:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">version: 2.1

                }
              },

                  }
                ]
              }
