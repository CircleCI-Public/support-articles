<p>There are cases where you may get added to projects in your organization erroneously or are no longer a part of an org but still receive build notifications. This can be annoying but is resolved easily!</p>

<h2 id="h_01HW64S4WXAZDJ3ZS0K5XAKXKD"><strong>I Still Have Access to The Project</strong></h2>
<p>If you are still a member of the project's organization, then all you have to do is log in to CircleCI, and unfollow the project from your Project's Dashboard.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="h_01HW64X8T3YNBPN60QP92Q4ZVW"><strong>I Do Not Have Access to The Project</strong></h2>
<p>If you cannot access the project anymore to unfollow it, <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">please reach out to CircleCI Support</a> and let us know the VCS organization name as well as the project that you are seeing the notifications for.
