<h3 id="h_01HH39E7FQ2KV2Q7MDRQW8ZJH0"><strong>I’m having trouble logging in to my account</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CircleCI uses OAuth login via your VCS provider (GitHub or Bitbucket) as well as email and password.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you created your account using <strong>OAuth login</strong>, navigate to </span><a href="https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize">https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize</a>.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you mistakenly logged in with a different account, contact <a href="https://support.circleci.com/" target="_self" rel="undefined">CircleCI Support</a> so they can manually unlink your accounts.
