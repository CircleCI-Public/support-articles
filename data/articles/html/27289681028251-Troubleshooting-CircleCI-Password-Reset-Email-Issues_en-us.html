<h2 id="h_01J2EY855A9PRWZX2YWHYY0JPC">Overview</h2>
<p>Users may encounter issues when attempting to reset their CircleCI password, such as not receiving the password reset email. This can occur even when other notifications from CircleCI are being received. Understanding the nature of the account creation and the associated login method is crucial for resolving this issue.</p>
<h2 id="h_01J2EY855AFS1G3MTJPBNJN2MJ">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Access to the email account associated with your CircleCI account.</li>
    <li>Knowledge of the account creation method (GitHub or email signup).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01J2EY855ACKA0C4C1BBP4E76T">Instructions</h2>
<p>If you're unable to receive a password reset email from CircleCI, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify Account Creation Method</strong>: Determine if you created your CircleCI account using GitHub credentials.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Login with GitHub</strong>: If you signed up with GitHub before September 2023, navigate to the CircleCI login page and select "Log In &gt; Signed up with Github or Bitbucket before September 2023?".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>GitHub Password Reset</strong>: If you've forgotten your GitHub password, reset it directly through GitHub's password recovery process.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Check Spam and Filters</strong>: If you signed up with an email, check your spam folder and email filters for messages from circleci.com.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01J2EY855AJGRMMB8V12FBZWJF">Solution</h2>
<p>For users who signed up with GitHub credentials, using the GitHub login option on CircleCI's login page is the correct method to access your account. The "Forgot Password?" feature will not work for these accounts. For email signups, ensure that emails from CircleCI are not being filtered or marked as spam.</p>
