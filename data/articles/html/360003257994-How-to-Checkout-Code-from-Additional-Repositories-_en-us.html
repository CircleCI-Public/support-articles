<h2 class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">Solution</h2>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">If you receive this error, more than likely you are attempting to access a private repository from within your container without authentication. You will need to create a "User Key" SSH key and add it to your job environment so that it can access additional resources that require additional authentication.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">More information on creating a user key can be found <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#enable-your-project-to-check-out-additional-private-repositories" target="_self">in our documentation</a>.</p>
