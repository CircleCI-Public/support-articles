<p>This means that the account has previously been authorized with CircleCI.</p>
<p>This can be solved by revoking CircleCI's OAuth token within your VCS account and attempting to authorize it once again.</p>
<p>If you still are unable to connect your VCS account, please raise a ticket with our support team and we will manually disconnect your VCS account for you.</p>
