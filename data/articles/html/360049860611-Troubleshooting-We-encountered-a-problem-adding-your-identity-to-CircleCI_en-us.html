<h1 id="h_01HE36QN7RJHW017VCJ8MKYA53">Problem:</h1>
<p>If you see the error "We encountered a problem adding your identity to CircleCI... The identity provided by your VCS service is already associated with a different account. Please try logging in using that account or contact us for further help.", this means that the VCS account you are trying to connect has previously been authorized with CircleCI.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HE36XMK8JMBQZWMFTP45NZ4N">Solutions:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Please try revoking CircleCI's access within your VCS account and attempt to authorize it once again.</li>
    <li>If you are still unable to connect your VCS account, <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">please raise a ticket with our Support team</a> and we will manually disconnect your VCS account for you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> Disconnecting a user might clear any user keys that have been generated for any of your projects with this user, so you will potentially need to regenerate these once the user is reconnected.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HE37WP9S6EHNXV6FKVN8YEBP">Outcome:</h2>
<p>If your user was previously connected to another CircleCI account, manually disconnecting it will enable you to connect it to your other CircleCI account.</p>
