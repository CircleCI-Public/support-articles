<p>Some users may find it difficult to add organizations to CircleCI from Github after the point of signup as a new oAuth token must be created with access to the new Org being granted access. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Remove all cookies for Circleci.com. You can do this by accessing your Chrome developer tools (right-click the page, and select "inspect") while on any page, navigating to "application" and deleting everything under cookies.</p>

<p>2. Click the "Login" button on the home page will become a "<strong>Sign Up</strong>" button. At the next screen, you will be asked to Authorize CircleCI, be sure to also select "Grant" next to the Organization you would like to add.</p>
