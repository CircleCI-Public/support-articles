<p>When trying to log into CircleCI, the login page kicks you back to the login page after logging in with no error message.</p>
<p>You may experience this when signing up with an email/password account and then try logging in with your GitHub account.</p>
<p>As you may be aware, <a href="https://circleci.com/legal/acceptable-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we have been putting efforts into identifying potential abusive use cases such as crypto-mining here at CircleCI</a>. This is an interesting but rather challenging effort.</p>

<p>To prevent abuse, CircleCI is constantly implementing abuse prevention mechanisms and techniques. Please try logging in with your GitHub account the next day.</p>
