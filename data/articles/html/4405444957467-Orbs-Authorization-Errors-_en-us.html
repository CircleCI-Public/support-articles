<h2>Troubleshooting Authorization errors: </h2>
<p>If you are getting an authorization error when trying to run orb commands please first ensure that the user has the correct permissions. You can find a permissions matrix for orb commands in our docs <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-author-intro/#permissions-matrix" target="_self">here </a></p>

<h2>Resetting your CircleCI API token:</h2>
<p>You may also try generating a <a href="https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens" target="_self">new personal API token.</a> You will need to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/local-cli#configuring-the-cli" target="_self">update the CircleCI CLI</a> so that the CIRCLE_TOKEN environment variable is set to the new value. Please make sure the CIRCLE_TOKEN environment variable is also updated in any related <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/contexts" target="_self">context</a></p>
