<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Experiencing a build failure in CircleCI without any error output can be puzzling. This article explores common causes for such failures and provides guidance on how to resolve them. It also addresses a specific scenario where the use of an incompatible Docker image led to a build reporting failure despite individual tasks succeeding.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Access to your CircleCI account.</li>
    <li>Familiarity with CircleCI configuration files (.circleci/config.yml).</li>
    <li>Understanding of Docker and containerization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>When encountering a build failure with no error output, consider the following steps to diagnose and fix the issue:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Verify Language and Package Versions</strong>: Ensure that the language and package versions match between your local environment and CircleCI.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Check Timezone Configurations</strong>: Confirm that your testing frameworks and build configurations are timezone-aware.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inspect File Ordering</strong>: Some tests may fail if they depend on a specific file order. CircleCI's filesystems are unordered, so ensure your tests do not rely on file ordering.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Monitor Memory Usage</strong>: Look out for "Out of Memory" errors which can terminate processes unexpectedly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Adjust for Startup Times</strong>: Services like databases may take longer to start on CircleCI. Implement explicit wait times in your config.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Validate External Services</strong>: If your build depends on third-party services, check their availability and operational status.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Review CircleCI Configuration</strong>: Examine your .circleci/config.yml for syntax errors or misconfigurations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Isolate Failing Steps</strong>: Try to pinpoint the exact step where the build fails to narrow down the cause.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Update Dependencies</strong>: Ensure all external dependencies and tools are up-to-date and compatible with your build.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>In a specific case, the issue was resolved by switching to a different Docker image that was compatible with the build requirements. The original image was a binary-only Docker image, which lacked an underlying operating system, making it unsuitable for the build process. Using an Alpine-based image instead led to a successful build.</p>

<p>If you encounter a similar issue, try the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Identify the Docker image used in your build.</li>
    <li>Replace the binary-only image with an Alpine-based image or another image that includes the necessary environment for your build.</li>
    <li>Update your .circleci/config.yml to reference the new image.</li>
    <li>Rerun the build to check if the issue is resolved.</li>
</ol>
