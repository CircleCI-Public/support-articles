<p>The GitHub API supports the ability to <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/comments/#create-a-comment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add comments to open Pull Requests</a>. With this in mind you can utilize environment variables and a cURL to automatically update/comment on a PR.</p>
<p>This could be utilized for reporting data collected during builds running on CircleCI, such as overall test coverage stats.</p>
<p>The first step would be to setup a new personal token for a user who will be making the comments, this could be you (the admin on the account) or a new bot user. Then set the username of who will make comments and the personal token as <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project-level environment variables</a>.</p>
<p><code>GH_USER</code> and <code>GH_TOKEN</code></p>
<p>Once that is complete you can add a new step that will check for an Open PR and post a comment to it:</p>
<pre>- run:<br>    name: Post Stats to GitHub PR<br>    command: |<br>      sudo apt-get install jq<br><br>      pr_response=$(curl --location --request GET "https://api.github.com/repos/$CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME/$CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME/pulls?head=$CIRCLE_PROJECT_USERNAME:$CIRCLE_BRANCH&amp;state=open" \<br>      -u $GH_USER:$GH_TOKEN)<br><br>      if [ $(echo $pr_response | jq length) -eq 0 ]; then<br>        echo "No PR found to update"<br>      else<br>        pr_comment_url=$(echo $pr_response | jq -r ".[]._links.comments.href")<br>      fi<br><br>      curl --location --request POST "$pr_comment_url" \<br>      -u $GH_USER:$GH_TOKEN \<br>      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \<br>      --data-raw '{<br>       "body": "This would be the data to add"<br>      }'</pre>
<p>Last step is to replace the "This would be the data to add" with the content you want added as a comment.</p>
