<p>Sometimes when attempting to view older data within the CircleCI user interface or API you may see a <strong>not found</strong> error, or data may be missing. This usually means that the build data falls outside of your data retention window.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CircleCI has a data retention policy for build data. <span>Build data includes information on all pipelines run, workflows within those pipelines (including reruns), and jobs within those workflows which can be seen in the CircleCI UI or retrieved via the API.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This policy ensures we keep our data to a manageable size and <span>our build systems performant and reliable</span> as we grow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any other data, like workspaces, caches, or artifacts are governed by their existing policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your plan we retain build data for the following periods :</span></p>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free Plans: 90 days</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance and Custom Plans: 180 days</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scale Plans: 2 years</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also set custom data retention periods for <strong>artifacts</strong>, <strong>workspaces</strong> and <strong>cache items</strong> by navigating to the <strong>Usage Controls</strong> in the <strong>Plan</strong> portal:</p>
