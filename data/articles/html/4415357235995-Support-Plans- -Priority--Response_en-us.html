    <h2 id="01HMAB60KV0T7XWZJNNH05JENR"><strong>Definitions used in this Reference Sheet</strong></h2>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">a. <strong>‘Error’</strong> means an error in the Software which significantly degrades such Software as compared to CircleCI’s published performance specifications contained in the User Documentation.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">b. <strong>‘Error Correction’</strong> means the use of reasonable commercial efforts to correct Errors.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">c. <strong>‘Fix’</strong> means the repair or replacement of object or executable code versions of the Software to remedy an Error.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">d. <strong>’Support Services’</strong> means using Ticket Support to provide Error Correction or a Workaround to a single technical support contact of Licensee concerning the use of the CircleCI Service.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">e. <strong>‘Support Ticket’</strong> means the documentation created from a request for Ticket Support, where CircleCI and Customer’s technical support contact may communicate regarding the reported Error.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">f. <strong>‘Ticket Support’</strong> means technical support assistance provided by CircleCI to Customer’s Technical <span class="wysiwyg-color-black">Support</span> Contact in accordance with the Priority Levels and Target Response Times, under the column applicable to the Support level chosen by Customer.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">g. <strong>'Timely Response'</strong> means that CircleCI will review the request and respond to it in a time frame commensurate with the impact to all Customers as a while and an individual Customer's chosen level of Support. This category does not include a hard time frame for response or resolution, but most Timely Response tickets should be responded to within one (1) business week, and will include resolution expectations, as applicable. </p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">h. <strong>'Workaround'</strong> means a change in the procedures followed or data supplied to avoid an Error without substantially impairing Customer's use of the Software. </p>
    <h2 id="h_01HBH1ZGH8GKKRY58KWDDRD07S"><strong>Error Severity and Priority Levels</strong></h2>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">a. CircleCI will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to correct any Error you report according to the priority level reasonably assigned to such Error by CircleCI.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">b. Response time begins when CircleCI sets the severity level of the Support Ticket; a response from CircleCI does not mean the Error has been resolved.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">c. If, during the Support Services inquiry process, the Error either warrants assignment of a higher severity level than currently assigned or no longer warrants the severity level currently assigned to the Error based on its current impact on the operation of the Software, then CircleCI will respectively upgrade or downgrade the severity level of the Error according to the severity level that most appropriately reflects the Error’s current impact on the Software.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">d. CircleCI will provide continuous efforts to resolve Urgent Priority severity Errors until a Fix, Workaround or other resolution can be provided or until the Error can be downgraded to a lower severity level.</p>
    <h2 id="h_01HBH1ZGH8EP0PG09AWGYVH1H4"><strong>Response and Resolution Times</strong></h2>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">a. All response times are based on your corporate headquarters’ local timezone.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">b. A <strong>‘business hour’</strong> means, once a severity level has been assigned, the amount of time CircleCI has to respond in accordance with the Support Plan you chose at the beginning of your Term.</p>
    <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">c. <span class="wysiwyg-underline">CircleCI Holidays</span>. For Free and Starter Support only, if a holiday occurs on a Saturday, your local CircleCI Support team will be limited on the Friday before the holiday. If a holiday occurs on a Sunday, your local CircleCI Support team will be limited on the Monday after the holiday. Standard, Advanced and Premium Support follow the Priority Levels and Response Coverage above.</p>

    <div>
        <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">d. CircleCI does not guarantee resolution times. A resolution may consist of a Fix, Workaround, or other solution that CircleCI deems reasonable. CircleCI will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the target Response Times stated in the table above.</p>
        <p>e. If you use a custom or unsupported plug-in, module, or code, CircleCI may ask you to remove the custom or unsupported plug-in, module, or code while attempting to resolve the Error. If the Error resolves once you remove the custom or unsupported plug-in, module, or code, CircleCI may consider the Error resolved.</p>
        <h2 id="h_01HBH1ZGH83CT3ZN750SJW68SR"><strong>Support Limitations; Disclaimer</strong></h2>
        <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">a. Support Tickets should be submitted through the support portal link in the header of this page.</p>
        <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">b. CircleCI may close Support Tickets if they are outside the scope of the Support Services or if we try to contact you multiple times regarding a Support Ticket, but you do not respond. If a Support Ticket is closed due to lack of response, you may request to have it reopened.</p>
        <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">c. CircleCI shall have no obligation to support: (i) altered or damaged Software or any portion of the Software incorporated with or into other software; (ii) Software problems not caused by an Error; or (iii) Software problems caused by your negligence, abuse, misapplication, or use of the Software other than as specified in CircleCI’s documentation or other causes beyond CircleCI’s control. CircleCI shall have no liability for any changes in your hardware that may be necessary to use the Software due to a Fix, Workaround, Upgrade or Release.</p>
        <p class="wysiwyg-text-align-justify">d. Software that is sunset or has reached its end-of-life is supported as-is. CircleCI cannot escalate any bug fixes, security patches or feature improvements on such Software.</p>
