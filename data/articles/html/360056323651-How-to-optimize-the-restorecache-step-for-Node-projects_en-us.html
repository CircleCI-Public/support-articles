<p dir="auto">The two main operations in the<span> </span><code>restore_cache</code><span> </span>step are: "<strong><em>download</em></strong>" and "<strong><em>unarchive</em></strong>".</p>
<p dir="auto">In the case of Node-related cache, we found that the "<strong><em>unarchive</em></strong>" operation can sometimes take a significant amount of time and that the duration can be inconsistent across builds.</p>
<p dir="auto"> </p>
<h3 dir="auto">The reason behind this</h3>
<p dir="auto">The issue described above is mostly due to <strong>Disk I/O contention</strong> occurring and is aggravated by the structure of Node dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto">Often "<em>node_modules</em>" folders will contain a huge number of small files, and restoring all these files can cause the aforementioned resource contention, and can lead to a high deviation in the<span> </span><code>restore_cache</code><span> </span>duration.</p>
<p dir="auto"> </p>
<h3 dir="auto">RAM disk</h3>
<p dir="auto">To improve the consistency of the<span> </span><code>restore_cache</code><span> step's </span>duration, we suggest using the<strong> <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/using-docker#ram-disks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAM disk</a></strong><span> </span>available for each container.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Note that depending on the jobs' memory usage, you might need to use/specify a larger <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#resourceclass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resource class</a> to ensure there is enough memory to leverage the RAM disk feature.</em></p>
