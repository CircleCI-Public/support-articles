<h1>Setting a "Timeout" To Cancel Builds</h1>
<p>There are situations where you may wish to cancel your build after a set amount of time, such as if you know you have long running tests and don't want to allow them to eat up credits.</p>
<p>You can add a <code style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">background</code> step that will accomplish this, think of it as starting a stop watch and when the set amount of time has elapsed, it will cancel the build.</p>
<p>First you'll need to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate a personal API</a> token and store that as a variable (<code style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">CIRCLE_TOKEN</code>) either in the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project settings</a> or a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener">context</a>. Once that is done, you can add this <code style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">run</code> command to your job that you want to have a timer on:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">- run:
    name: Cancel build after set time
    background: true
    command: |
      sleep 1000
      echo "Canceling workflow as too much time has elapsed"
      curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" "https://circleci.com/api/v2/workflow/${CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID}/cancel?circle-token=${CIRCLE_TOKEN}" </pre>
<p>The only adjustment in the above step you'll need to make is for how long you want to wait before the API call executes, change that by adjusting the <code>sleep 1000</code> to the value of how long you want to wait.</p>
