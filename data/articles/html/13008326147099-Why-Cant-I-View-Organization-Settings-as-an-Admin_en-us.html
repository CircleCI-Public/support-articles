<p>If your organization shares a Pricing Plan with a parent org, please confirm that your VCS username is a member of that org. This will ensure you have the proper permissions to view org settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note: It is not recommended for user accounts to share their plan, since user accounts cannot add members.Â </strong></p>
