<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>Python 2 is no longer installed for macOS images from Xcode 11.4 onwards. This is due to homebrew deleting the Python 2 formula after it being deprecated for several years.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The current workaround is to install the `pyenv` package from homebrew. This will link the `python` and `pip` commands to python 3.7 instead.</p>
<pre>- run: brew install pyenv</pre>
