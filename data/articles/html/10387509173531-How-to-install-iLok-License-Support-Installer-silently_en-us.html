<p dir="auto">This guide is for installing the iLok License Support Installer silently for use within CircleCI, it is split into two sections you need to generate a .iss file and the second is to use the file to silently install the software.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Generating the .iss file</h2>
<p>You will need to <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/5170139355547-How-to-rerun-a-job-with-SSH" target="_self">re-run a windows job with SSH</a> for the <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/5170139355547-How-to-rerun-a-job-with-SSH" target="_self">RDP step</a> later on.</p>
<p dir="auto">The iLok license support install software can be downloaded <a href="https://installers.ilok.com/iloklicensemanager/LicenseSupportInstallerWin64.zip" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">To download this within your <em>config.yml</em> CircleCI job you can use the following command alternatively you can run the following two commands on the executor using a PowerShell window if you prefer omitting the <em>-run:</em></p>
<div>
    <pre><span>-run: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://installers.ilok.com/iloklicensemanager/LicenseSupportInstallerWin64.zip -OutFile C:\Users\circleci\License.zip</span></pre>
</div>
<p dir="auto">This will download the install to the location <span>C:\Users\circleci\License.zip</span><span></span></p>
<p dir="auto"><span>Once this is complete you can use the following command to expand the .zip to <em>C:\Users\circleci\</em></span></p>
<div>
    <pre><span>- run: Expand-Archive -Path C:\Users\circleci\License.zip -DestinationPath C:\Users\circleci\</span></pre>
</div>
<p dir="auto">You will now have the expanded directory located at <em>C:\Users\circleci\</em></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>At this point, you will need to connect to the windows machine using RDP using our guide linked <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051808652-Connecting-to-Remote-Desktop-RDP-on-Windows-jobs" target="_self">here</a>.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><span>Once connected to the machine over RDP you will need to run the program using the -r argument on the installer .exe to generate the .iss file, you will require RDP as the installer requires the GUI to complete the install.</span></p>
<p dir="auto"><span>You can use the following command on a PowerShell window to start the installer.</span></p>
<div>
    <pre><span>&amp; 'C:\Users\circleci\LicenseSupportInstallerWin64_v5.6.3_46ee731e\License Support Win64.exe' -r </span></pre>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><span>You can also specify where to store the .iss file with the -f1 option (i.e. License Support Win64.exe -r -f1“C:\Temp\SilentInstall.iss”).</span></p>
<p dir="auto"><span>At this point, you should have a file called <strong>setup.iss</strong> located under <strong>C:\Windows</strong> or where you have specified if using the <strong>-f1</strong> parameter. </span></p>
<p dir="auto"><span>You can copy and paste this file from the RDP session to your local machine by either dragging and dropping or using the copy-and-paste function.</span></p>
<p dir="auto">You will need to upload this file to a location that is accessible by a CircleCI job for use on the silent install. We would recommend adding this to your VCS and using the special checkout step to pull this file.</p>
<p dir="auto">The second part of this guide will assume the file is accessible from the top level of your VCS.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Silent install</h2>
<p>The following config.yml will complete the silent install and each step is explained below</p>
<pre dir="auto">version: 2.1<br>orbs:<br>  win: circleci/windows@2.2.0<br>jobs:<br>  build:<br>    executor:<br>     name: win/default<br>     shell: powershell.exe<br>  steps:<br>    - checkout<br>    - run: <br>      command: |<br>        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://installers.ilok.com/iloklicensemanager/LicenseSupportInstallerWin64.zip -OutFile C:\Users\circleci\License.zip<br>        Expand-Archive -Path C:\Users\circleci\License.zip -DestinationPath C:\Users\circleci\<br>        &amp; 'C:\Users\circleci\LicenseSupportInstallerWin64_v5.6.3_46ee731e\License Support Win64.exe' -s -f1“C:\Users\circleci\project\setup.iss”<br>workflows:<br>  workflow:<br>    jobs:<br>      - build</pre>
<p dir="auto">The checkout step pulls down the contents from your VCS into the C:\Users\circleci\project\ folder in the example above the <strong>setup.iss</strong> file is located at the top level.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Invoke-WebRequest and Expand-Archive commands are the same commands from the generating the .iss file section above.</p>
<p dir="auto">The final line of the command section does the silent install by having the License Support installer and “.iss” file defined if your <strong>setup.iss</strong> that was generated is located in another location please change the final section to the full directory of the file.</p>
<p dir="auto">It will run “License Support Win64.exe” using the -s switch along with pointing it to the “.iss” file on the command line which will silently install the software.</p>
