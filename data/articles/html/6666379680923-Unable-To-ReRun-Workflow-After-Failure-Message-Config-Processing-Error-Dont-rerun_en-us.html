<h1>Config Processing Error</h1>
<p>If you encounter the error shown below:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><span style="font-style: code;">Warning: This configuration was auto-generated to show you the message above.
Don't rerun this job. Rerunning will have no effect.</span></pre>
<p>you have a <code>Config Processing Error</code>, meaning there was something in your previous <code style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">.circleci/config.yml</code> file that caused it to be considered invalid and no workflow was actually run. Re-running the workflow would result in the same message and failure since the config file has not been changed to a valid state. This is why re-running workflows with this type of failure is not an option in CircleCI.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The best way to fix this error is to edit your config to fix any mistakes within it, commit those changes and trigger another build through a GitHub Pull Request.</p>
