<h3 id="h_01HYAHS02VPX8DPDMFJ27BMB8W">1) Review Step Outputs</h3>
<p>Review each <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#step" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">step</a>â€™s output to ensure it is completing as expected. This is important because steps can silently fail or not work as intended. For example, if a caching key is not found in the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#restorecache" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">restore_cache step</a> it will not fail.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HYAHVC75X5JM55AE5W9FBQVJ">2) Review Step Placement</h3>
<p>Review each step to see if it makes sense to have that step in the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#job" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">job</a>. A job typically has a singular purpose and steps may fit better in their own job or in a different order. For example, if linting and unit tests are being done in the same job it may be a good idea to move the unit tests to a separate job. Especially if setting up dependencies for those tests are quick.</p>
<p>Having separation between various aspects of the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pipeline</a> allows those jobs to be run in parallel, reducing overall duration. The separation also provides clearer feedback when a pipeline fails.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HYAHWG9CPVZSNKBR2FZ4F150">3) Record Reusable Config Opportunities</h3>
<p>Note any steps, groups of steps, <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#executor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executors</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/reusing-config/#using-the-parameters-declaration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parameters</a>, or jobs that are repeated in the config. Creating <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/reusing-config/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reusable config keys</a> allows those keys to be more easily maintained. For example, if a job uses <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/env-vars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">environment variables</a> for credentials and those variables change they only need to be updated in one place.</p>
<p><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/reusing-config/#authoring-parameterized-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parameterizing jobs</a> can be a great way to make the config easier to maintain. <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043638052-Conditional-steps-in-jobs-and-conditional-workflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steps can be conditional</a> to allow for multiple situations, for example a staging environment vs production. Jobs can be conditional and have <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#pre-steps-and-post-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre or post steps</a> added to them which expands how parameterized jobs can be used.</p>
<p>If any of these reusable config keys are used in other <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects</a>, consider <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/orb-concepts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating an orb</a> to allow those keys to be used cross project and be maintained in one place.</p>
