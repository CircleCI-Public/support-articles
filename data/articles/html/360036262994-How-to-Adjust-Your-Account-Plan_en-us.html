<h2><strong>Upgrade to the Performance Plan</strong></h2>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are interested in accessing more tools such as higher concurrency (Performance’s default is 80x concurrency) or scaling for user growth, the Performance Plan may be a better fit for your team’s needs. As a user, upgrading to the Performance Plan can be achieved directly in your UI Plan Usage Page. </span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once inside your Plan Usage Page, a cost estimate will be presented based on your activity on our platform. You can toggle between a number of users and compute credits which will then generate a cost estimate for your plan.</span></h4>

<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note, if you are only making adjustments to your billing/payment information and are continuing to use the same account on CircleCI, your build history and project settings (environment variables, advance settings, checkout keys, etc.) will remain intact.</span></h4>
