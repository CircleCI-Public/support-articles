<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This article shares how CircleCI Server 4.x administrators can confirm which resources were deployed during a Server 4.x version upgrade.</p>
<p>This can be useful in confirming if a certain deployment (e.g., output-processor) was re-deployed, for instance.<br><br></p>
<h2>Use --debug option with Helm Upgrade</h2>
<p>When upgrading a Server 4.x via Helm, you can include the `--debug` option.</p>
<p><br>The verbose output will show which Kubernetes resources are redeployed or skipped (e.g., when there are no changes).</p>
<pre>helm upgrade circleci-server \<br>  oci://cciserver.azurecr.io/circleci-server \<br>  -n $namespace \<br>  --version &lt;version&gt; \<br>  -f &lt;path-to-values.yaml&gt; \<br>  --debug</pre>
<p> </p>
<h2>Note that this is applicable <strong>only during the upgrade</strong> itself.<br><br>Outcome</h2>
<p>You can see the debug information on which Kubernetes resources are redeployed or skipped for updates.</p>
