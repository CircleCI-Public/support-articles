<h1>Open Source Credits</h1>
<p><span>Open Source projects receive 400,000 credits per month (equivalent to 40,000 build minutes) to use on Linux, and 25,000 credits per month (equivalent to 500 build minutes) for macOS. </span>Although Open Source credit availability will not be visible in the UI, these credits are only consumed by open source projects, and do not contribute towards your overall credit consumption. If you are blocked from building, please submit a ticket to Support or write to <a href="mailto:support@circleci.com">support@circleci.com</a> You can find more information on this here: <a href="https://circleci.com/open-source/">https://circleci.com/open-source/</a></p>
