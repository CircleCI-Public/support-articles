<h3 id="h_01HXVXZRZ16M6SBEHP490F6XEA">1) Look at New Features</h3>
<p>CircleCI releases features at a fast pace and there may be something new that can help your <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>. Check the <a href="https://circleci.com/changelog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changelog</a> for new features and see if any can help with your use case.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HXVXZWDRYYS07S5PDWHK8R8A">2) Check the Configuration Reference</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">configuration reference</a> is a list of all configuration keys available in a CircleCI config file. It can be useful to read through the right sidebar and see if any keys are of interest.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HXVXZZZV0FY055TZPMFZMAHK">3) Record Features of Interest</h3>
<p>Record any features of interest for reference throughout the config review. If any recorded features are found not to be helpful, note why for future reference.</p>
