<h1>Caching Error on macOS</h1>
<p>When restoring a cache on a macOS job, you may run into the following error:</p>
<pre class="css-dm1rdx">Downloading cache archive...
Validating cache...

Unarchiving cache...

Failed to unarchive cache

Error untarring cache: Error extracting tarball /var/... : home/circleci/project/...: Cannot extract through symlink</pre>
<p>This error is commonly caused by trying to extract a cache that has been created on a Docker or Machine job. It is not advisable to share caches between different executor types as features such as symlinks or permissions metadata can differ and cause issues.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>To work around this, use a cache key that includes the platform you are running the job on. For example:</p>
<pre>node-v1-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}</pre>
<p>Can become:</p>
<pre>node-v1-<span>{{ arch }}</span>-{{ .Branch }}-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}</pre>
<p>This "arch" key includes the OS and CPU architecture information which will ensure the cache is unique to that particular combination in use on the executor.</p>
