<p>When attempting to run a job in CircleCI for the first time, you may encounter the error: <em>"<strong>event cannot have more than 20 hooks</strong>".</em></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Typically, this happens when you have too many webhooks configured on the VCS provider. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks" target="_self">In GitHub you can create up to 20 webhooks</a> for each event on each installation target (specific organization or specific repository).</p>
