<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Build timeouts are enforced at the plan level. <span>Jobs have a maximum runtime of 1 (Free), 3 (Performance), or 5 (Scale) hours depending on pricing plan. </span></p>
<p><span>Since Server customers are on a scale plan, builds on our Server offering time out after 5 hours.</span></p>
<h2><span>Can I configure this to be shorter?</span></h2>
<p><span>Yes! </span><span>This can be done by using the <code>no_output_timeout</code> parameter for <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#run">run</a> gives users the option to change the no-output timeout from the default 10 minutes to a user-specified timeout. More details about decreasing your time out can be found in the following support article:</span></p>

<h2>Can I increase this timeout?</h2>
<p>At this time, it is not possible to increase this time out past the the current 5 hour limit. There is an open feature request which can be seen at the link below for this to be implemented:</p>
