<h3 id="h_01HXVXE6N98MDKZPXFWKXV6JJB">Create a Document for the Review</h3>
<p>Most organizations have more than one <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a> on CircleCI and will most likely need to do more than one config review. Creating a format or template that can be used for all config reviews can be helpful to ensure they are standardized.</p>
<p>The following information should be included in the document:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Goals</li>
    <li>Project metrics</li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#job" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Job</a> specific recommendations
    </li>
    <li>High level recommendations</li>
    <li>Place for documentation links</li>
</ul>
<p>As the config review is conducted, you will most likely find yourself referencing all sorts of documentation both internal and external. Recording the links to those docs can be very helpful for anyone working on the changes after the review or who wants to understand why a certain recommendation was made.</p>
