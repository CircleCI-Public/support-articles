<h1>Preinstalled Software</h1>
<p>The CircleCI Windows image comes with software pre-installed . You can find a list of Software pre-installed in the Windows image <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/hello-world-windows/#software-pre-installed-in-the-windows-image" target="_self">here</a>. The Windows image comes with <a href="https://chocolatey.org/" target="_self">Chocolatey Package Manager</a> pre-installed too. </p>
<h2>Additional Software</h2>
<p>If you require software that is not already pre-installed in the image, you can install it by adding an installation step. Below you can find an example `config.yml` that uses chocolatey to install python 3.8.0 :</p>
