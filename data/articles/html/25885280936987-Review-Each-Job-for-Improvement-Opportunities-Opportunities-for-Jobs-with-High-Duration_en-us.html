<h3 id="h_01HYAKQ2BC81QYG1WVP8J94F4Z">1) Resource Allocation</h3>
<p>Optimizing the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#resource-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resource classes</a> of your <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#job" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jobs</a> is an easy way to ensure <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">credits</a> aren’t being wasted. Each job has a resource tab in the UI showing the resource usage throughout the job, which is useful while reviewing jobs individually. <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/resource-class-overview/#resource-class-insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CircleCI’s Insights UI</a> offers a view of historical usage for every job in a workflow which is more helpful when doing a config review.</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is a job should be using 50% - 75% of its resources. If a job is outside of that band try out one of <a href="https://circleci.com/product/features/resource-classes/#:~:text=Available%20Resource%20Classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the other resource classes</a> for the execution environment being used.</p>
<p>NOTE: Increasing resource class size does not guarantee a job’s duration will be reduced.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HYAKPZBJ8Q7X2F956KRFJW5W">2) Caching</h3>
<p>Jobs that install dependencies should <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cache those dependencies</a> to speed up install time for future jobs. Caches are <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a> wide so multiple jobs and multiple workflows can share them.</p>
<p>Most dependencies support using a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/caching-strategy/#partial-dependency-caching-strategies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fallback cache key</a> to allow for a partial cache match. Implementing a fallback cache key can help reduce duration when making changes on a new branch.</p>
<p>Review how <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/caching-strategy/#avoid-strict-cache-keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specific any current cache keys</a> are and if they need to be more or less specific.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HYAKQ5MBZ9VD23220W55ZDNJ">3) Test splitting</h3>
<p>Jobs that run tests can most likely be split. <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/parallelism-faster-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test splitting</a> runs multiple instances of the job in parallel and splits the tests among them, with <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/parallelism-faster-jobs/#how-test-splitting-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">splitting by timing</a> being the more optimized approach. The <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/parallelism-faster-jobs/#specify-a-jobs-parallelism-level" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parallelism of the job</a> should be set to balance dependency setup time versus test suite duration. The Timing tab in each job’s UI is helpful when reviewing that balance.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HYAKQ9HY1ZKRJFSZPMKFS6W2">4) Docker Layer Caching</h3>
<p>Jobs that build docker images can typically benefit from enabling <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/docker-layer-caching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Layer Caching</a>. DLC caches individual docker image layers so they can be used in future jobs.</p>
