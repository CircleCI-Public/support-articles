<p>Invoices/Statements can only be view by an organization's admin. To help identify your organization's admins, please reference the articles below:</p>

<p>Please note that <em>only</em> users on a performance plan can access the billing tab. Those on a custom performance plan will <em>not</em> be able to view the billing tab in the UI. </p>
<h2 id="h_01HHMQVHNMCW7T59G61VPEP0VM"><strong>Where can I find a credit refill receipt?</strong></h2>
<p>Credit refill transactions will be displayed on your statement. Since refills occur mid-billing cycle, they will not be viewable until your statement is finalized. The statement will be finalized on your statement subscription renewal date. Your statement will run from the same periods each month. For example, 2/4/2023-3/4/2023 and the following one would run 3/4/2023-4/4/2023.  You can find your billing period in your statement. </p>
