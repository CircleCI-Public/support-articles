<h1>Utilizing BASH_ENV</h1>
<p>CircleCI defines an environment variable called BASH_ENV at the start of every build. You can see what this variable is set to at the "Spinning up environment" step.</p>
<p>This can be overridden in the config file, or anywhere else that environment variables can be set (e.g. project settings, contexts, etc.).</p>
<p> If the file exists, it will be sourced with code like the following before every step is executed:</p>
<pre>. $BASH_ENV </pre>
<p>This is useful for all sorts of things. For instance, if a piece of code generates environment variables used in later steps, adding those variables to the BASH_ENV file is how to get that done.</p>
