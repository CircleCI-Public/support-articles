<h3 id="h_01HYAGWH9Q3V05KNDJMV2WJY87">1) Gather Project Metrics</h3>
<p>The UI can be used to gather metrics, but when doing multiple config reviews it is helpful to write a script that uses the CircleCI API. There are many <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/insights/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights</a> endpoints available to choose from, but a good place to start is the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/getProjectWorkflowsPageData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project summary endpoint</a> which provides metrics down to the branch level for <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workflows</a> in the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project</a>.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HYAGYPNVW5K9WM7RYCKTXB3M">2) Separate Out Significant Branches</h3>
<p>Metrics for all branches can be useful but for certain metrics, like success rate or mean time to recovery, it is helpful to separate out important branches. Branches such as main, staging, qa, etc. have different expectations, so metric goals will be different as well. The <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/getProjectWorkflowsPageData" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project summary endpoint</a> can be filtered to show specific branches.</p>
