<h1>Why Do Projects Get Suspended?</h1>
<p>You may encounter this error when triggering builds:</p>
<pre><span>"We did not run this pipeline because the project has been suspended.<br>Please contact us if you think this is a mistake."</span></pre>
<p>CircleCI often uses automation to detect anomalies in our system and will suspend any project that violates our <a href="https://circleci.com/legal/acceptable-use/" target="_self">Acceptable Use and Crypto-Mining policies</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What Are Some Common Cases?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Accessing CircleCI from a country on our list of <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043679453-CircleCI-Terms-of-Service-Violation-Sanctioned-Country" target="_self">Sanctioned Countries</a>
    </li>
    <li>Attempting to use CircleCI to mine cryptocurrency</li>
    <li>Maliciously abusing or attacking CircleCI with automated bots and DDOS attacks</li>
</ul>
<h2>Is It Possible To Get Unsuspended?</h2>
<p>Yes! If you believe that your account or project has been suspended erroneously, please submit a ticket to our Support team. We will review your case to determine if the suspension should remain in place, or if you have been flagged erroneously. </p>
