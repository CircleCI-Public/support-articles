<h1>Append To/Create $BASH_ENV</h1>
<p>The $BASH_ENV environment variable holds a string that holds the location of a file in the /tmp directory. This is used to pass values between steps in a CircleCI Job.</p>
<p>Typically this is appended to and created within the same step:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">- run: echo "export MY_ENV_VAR=example" &gt;&gt; $BASH_ENV</pre>
<p>If a build tries to access that value before it has been created it will result in a not found error:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">- run: cat $BASH_ENV
cat: /tmp/.bash_env-5f3d6eeXXXXXXXa54XXXX-0-build: No such file or directory</pre>
<p>The solution can be to either make sure to run at least one step that appends values to the file listed in $BASH_ENV or to simply touch the file:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">- run: touch $BASH_ENV</pre>
<p>Â </p>
