<p data-renderer-start-pos="7877">When a docker or a machine executor runs out of ram while compiling an android application the process that will be killed is Gradle as it uses such a large amount of ram. To resolve this issue you need to either <strong>increase the resources available</strong> or you can set a limit within your <strong>gradle.properties</strong></p>
<h2 data-renderer-start-pos="8009">Prerequisites</h2>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="7877">The following error will be seen if you are running out of ram. You can also check the resources tab to confirm if you are reaching 100% ram usage.</p>

<h2 data-renderer-start-pos="8207">Resolution</h2>

<p>To limit your ram open your <strong>gradle.properties</strong> you will need to edit the <strong>jvmargs</strong> as shown below you can raise or lower these values to suit but if you are running into the error shown above please try reducing the amount of both values.</p>
<pre>org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xms512m -Xmx2048m</pre>
