<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><code>sudo apt-key list | grep "expired:"</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<h2>Pre-Built Docker Image</h2>
<p>If you are using a CircleCI pre-built Docker Image and are getting an "Expired GPG key" error in your build. You can resolve this issue by simply upgrading to a newer version of the image you are using. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Custom Image</h2>
<p>If you are using a custom image you can upgrade your GPG keys with:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><code>apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys KEY_ID</code></pre>
<p>You will need to run this command with the KEY_ID of the expired key(s).</p>
