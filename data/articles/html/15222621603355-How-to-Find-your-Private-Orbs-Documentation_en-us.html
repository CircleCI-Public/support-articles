<h1 id="h_01HH3D6HNGFXP38TQ1RJN3372F">Overview</h1>
<p><a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs">Our public orb registry</a> features documentation to go along with every public orb that can be referenced with usage examples, jobs and their respective parameters, commands, as well the Orb's source code.</p>
<p>Many users find value in having this documentation and reference to distribute amongst their teams as well for other users in the community to utilize these orb examples. When creating a private orb or converting to private, this visibility is lost on the open registry due the nature of private orbs.</p>
