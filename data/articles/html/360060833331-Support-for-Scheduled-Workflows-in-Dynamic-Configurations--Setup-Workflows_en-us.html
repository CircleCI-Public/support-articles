Since that announcement went live, we’ve been closely tracking your feedback and feature requests, and have decided to postpone the deprecation - no new timelines are set yet. We know that there is more work we need to do in order to improve the existing Scheduled Pipelines experience and also make migration easier for all. We will share updates as we have them.</span>

<h2>Scheduled Workflows vs. Scheduled Pipelines</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/scheduled-pipelines/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many advantages</a> to switching over to scheduled pipelines, some being:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The ability to utilize dynamic configuration without a workaround</li>
    <li>Allowed use of auto-canceling</li>
    <li>The ability to modify the schedule without having to edit<span> </span><code class="highlighter-rouge language-plaintext" style="background-color: #f3f3f3;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">.circleci/config.yml</code>
    </li>
