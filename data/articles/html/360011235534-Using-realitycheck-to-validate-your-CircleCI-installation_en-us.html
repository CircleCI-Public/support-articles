<p><a href="https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>realitycheck</strong></a> is a CircleCI repository that can be used to validate the basic features of a hosted CircleCI installation.</p>
<p>To run realitycheck, fork the repository and start building it on your installation of CircleCI. See <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/project-build" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Projects and Builds</a> in our documentation or <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhjwnTD4oec" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Get Started on CircleCI</a> on YouTube for guidance on adding new project to CircleCI.</p>
<p>If your organization uses GitHub Enterprise rather than github.com, you will need to first create an empty repository in GitHub Enterprise and then add realitycheck to it.</p>
<p>To do so, either clone your new repository to your local machine, pull in our repository, and then push it back to GHE (see below); or else <a href="https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck/archive/master.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download realitycheck as a .zip file</a>, expand it, and then upload the contents of the resultant <strong><code>realitycheck-master</code></strong> directory to your new GHE repository via the GitHub Enterprise UI, making sure to include hidden files (CircleCI configuration files live in a <strong><code>.circleci</code></strong> directory that is hidden by default on most operating systems).</p>
<p>To successfully run realitycheck, you will need to configure certain environment variables and generate a CircleCI API token—<a href="https://github.com/circleci/realitycheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see the repository's README for details</a>. The README also contains further information about which specific features are tested, and how they are tested.</p>
