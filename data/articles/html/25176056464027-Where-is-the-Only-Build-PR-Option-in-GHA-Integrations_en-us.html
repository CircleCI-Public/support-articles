<h1 id="h_01HWB16E4WQX4FGA7WXAQEHNFS"><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>Some users with GitHub Apps integrations may have noticed that there is no option to "Only Build Pull Requests" for GHA projects. This is unfortunately due to a limitation with GHA.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="h_01HWB84JYPCJDG33AA064H0HS7"><strong>What's The Issue?</strong></h2>
<p>Due to the fact that GHA has a different back-end service compared to the GH Auth integration, the "Only Build Pull Requests" feature is not possible at this time. This is mentioned <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/github-apps-integration/#only-build-pull-requests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here in our documentation.</a></p>
