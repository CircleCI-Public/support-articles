<h1 id="h_01HVKWFGTGR22BDQCD41GQSY2E">Scheduled Pipelines</h1>
<p>There is a <strong>limit of 50</strong> scheduled pipelines per project. This limit cannot be increased at this time. </p>
<h2 id="h_01HVKWWZ9GAV59WYHSYXJNY14Q">Considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A scheduled pipeline can only be configured for one branch. If you need to schedule for two branches, you would need to set up two schedules.</li>
    <li>Scheduled pipelines are not currently available for GitLab and GitHub App projects. To find out if you authorized your GitHub account through the GitHub OAuth app, or the GitHub App, see the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/github-apps-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub App integration page.</a>
