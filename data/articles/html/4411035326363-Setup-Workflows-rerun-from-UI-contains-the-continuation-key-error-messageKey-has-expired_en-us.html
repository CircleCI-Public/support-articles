<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Setup workflows are apart of the CircleCI dynamic configuration feature. This allows for conditional and dynamic generation of configurations depending on pipeline values or file paths.</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">This error will be encountered if you attempt to re-run the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/dynamic-config/#how-dynamic-config-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setup workflow</a> from the UI.<br><br>For security and consistency reasons, continuation is allowed once per pipeline, and only for a certain amount of time after the setup phase started. This is due to a one-time-use token that is used by the setup workflow to create more workflows via a pipeline continuation API. To solve this issue, make a fresh commit and PR to trigger a new pipeline which will result in the creation of a new token for the setup workflow.</span></p>
