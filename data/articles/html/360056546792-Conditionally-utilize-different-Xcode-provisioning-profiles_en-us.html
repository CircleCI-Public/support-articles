<h1>Conditionally Deploy by Branch</h1>
<p>You may want a build on a specific branch to deploy to the App Store, while all other branches deploy as ad-hoc. This can be accomplished with Fastlane and setting specific profiles using <code>PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER</code>.</p>
<h2>Fastlane setup</h2>
<p>Then you can adjust your Fastfile to have an if/else conditional like the following:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"># fastlane/Fastfile
default_platform(:ios)

platform :ios do
  before_all do
    setup_circle_ci
  end

  desc "Runs tests and build the app"
  lane :testandbuild do |options|
    if(options[:branch] == "main")
      match(type: "appstore", readonly: "false")
      build_app
    else
       match(type: "adhoc")
       gym(export_method: "ad-hoc")
    end       
  end
end</pre>
<p>Beyond the above you will also need to specify the <code>PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER</code>, information on that here:</p>

<p>Once the above is done it is just a matter of passing in the branch as an option to your Fastlane run command. Like the following:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">- run: bundle exec fastlane ios testandbuild branch:${CIRCLE_BRANCH}</pre>
