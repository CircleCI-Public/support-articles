<h1>Check Installation</h1>
<p>A CircleCI build can output the following message during the <em>Checkout code</em> step: "Either git or ssh (required by git to clone through SSH) is not installed in the image". Falling back to CircleCI's native git client but the behavior may be different from official git. The first step to take in troubleshooting this issue is to check if you have git and openssh-client installed on your image. This can be done with the following commands:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><code>git --version</code></pre>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><code>ssh -V</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<h2>Install Git and OpenSSH Client</h2>
<p>Git and SSH can either be built into the Docker image or installed during the build.<br><br>For example, in a Debian based system they can be installed via:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><code>- run: apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y openssh-client git</code></pre>
<p>On Alpine based images, they can be installed via:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><code>- run: apk add --update openssh-client git</code></pre>
<p><br>CircleCI also provides <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-Built CircleCI Docker Images</a> which come with SSH, Git, and several other tools required by the build agent.</p>
