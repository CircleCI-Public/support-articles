<p>You may be using a Docker resource class with a 16GB or higher memory limit. However, be mindful that Remote Docker is not using the resource class resources that you specify.</p>
<p><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images/#specifications" target="_self">Remote Docker containers have a <strong>set limit of 8GB</strong> memory</a>. Any instructions for the Remote Docker will be executed on the remote container with 8GB memory. As such you may hit an <code>OOM 137</code> error at 8GB regardless of the resources available to the Docker executor resource class you selected.</p>
<p>You may want to consider using an appropriately sized <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#using-machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">machine executor</a> in place of Remote Docker. This way you will have control of the specifications of the executor you wish to build on.</p>
