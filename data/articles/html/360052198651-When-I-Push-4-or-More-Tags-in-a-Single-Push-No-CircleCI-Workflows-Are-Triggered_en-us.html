<h1 dir="auto">Missing Webhook</h1>
<p dir="auto">This actually stems from the GitHub side of things:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://developer.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#push" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://developer.github.com/webhooks/event-payloads/#push</a></p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
    <p dir="auto">Note: You will not receive a webhook for this event when you push more than three tags at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Since we rely on a GitHub webhook to trigger builds, and the above notes that one isn't generated when 3 or more additional tags are involved, this would be a case where you would not see a build triggered in CircleCI.</p>
<p dir="auto">Â </p>
<h2 dir="auto">Solution</h2>
<p dir="auto">You will want to ensure you are only pushing up to three tags at a time if you want builds triggered within CircleCI.</p>
