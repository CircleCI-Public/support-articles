<p dir="auto">In the past, we've seen this happen with a user using a username such as<span> </span><code>ThreeTwoStooge</code><span> </span>but org is<span> </span><code>threetwostooge</code>, for example. To workaround this error:</p>
<p>[Recommended] The user can create a new workspace on BitBucket that has a different name to their username. Then they can transfer their repo from the <code>threetwostooge</code> workspace to the new workspace.<span> </span><a href="https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/transfer-repository-ownership/#:~:text=From%20the%20repository%20you%20want,want%20to%20transfer%20the%20repository." rel="noreferrer">Here are the Bitbucket docs on how to do that</a>.</p>
