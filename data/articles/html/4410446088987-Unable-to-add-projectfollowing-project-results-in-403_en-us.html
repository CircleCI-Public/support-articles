<h1>SSO Auth Issues</h1>
<p>An uncommon, yet not impossible situation can arise due to SSO authentication issues with GitHub where a newly created repo, such as <a href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/oss-mac" target="_self">this open source CircleCI-Public repo</a>, is unable to be added as a project. <br><br>Another situation can arise if the project is then added by another authenticated repo owner and then  said user clicks "Follow Project" which results in a 403.</p>
