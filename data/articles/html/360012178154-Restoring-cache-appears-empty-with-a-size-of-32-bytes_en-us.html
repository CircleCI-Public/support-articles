<p>If you find yourself in a situation where your cache is being restored successfully but you believe that the files you are expecting are missing, take a look at the size of the cache being restored.</p>
<pre><code>
Found a cache from build 1 at v1-CACHE_KEY
Size: 32 B Cached paths: * /home/circleci/...
Downloading cache archive...
Validating cache...
Unarchiving cache...

<p>The 32B file size indicates the size of an empty tarball which was created in the previous <code>save cache</code> step.</p>

Skipping cache generation, cache already exists for key:

<p> </p>
<p>Take a look at the <code>save cache</code> step and ensure the proper paths are being saved and their contents are not empty.</p>
<p>You can implement <code>ls</code> commands within your config to help identify what files are going to be saved or connect to your container over <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/ssh-access-jobs/">SSH to manually inspect</a>.</p>
