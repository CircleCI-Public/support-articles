<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>If you are setting up a project for the first time, where you already have multiple branches on your repository, you may notice only your <code>default</code> branch is building. </p>
<p>This is expected behavior.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>To have the branch show up in the CircleCI App UI, you can push a new commit to the branch you are looking for and CircleCI will build it if there is a <code>config.yml</code> present.</p>
