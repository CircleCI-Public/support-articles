<p>On the <a href="https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/notifications" target="_self">notifications page</a>, it is possible to set the notification settings per organization.</p>
<p>An example screenshot can be found below:</p>

<p>If you cannot find your organization in the list, <strong>you may need to follow at least one project for the organization</strong> - this is not related to the permission settings of the project within your VCS, but the matter of CircleCI permission.</p>
<p>Please make sure you are following projects here: https://app.circleci.com/projects/project-dashboard/&lt;vcs&gt;/&lt;org-name&gt;/</p>
<p>Following a project enables a user to subscribe to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/notifications/">email notifications</a> for the project <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/status/">build status</a> and adds the project to their CircleCI dashboard.</p>
