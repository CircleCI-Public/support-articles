<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Organizations can need additional contacts for either Security or Service related notifications. Adding additional security or technical contacts ensures that communications reach those at a company who are not admins on their organization but are responsible for the operations and security of an Organization using the CircleCI platform for their CI/CD.  By default, notices are sent to the organization's admins and the primary contact in CircleCI's Customer Relationship Management software.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>These changes can only be made by an organization's admin. To help identify your organization's admins, please reference the articles below:</p>

<h2>How to Add Additional Contacts</h2>
<p>As an organization Admin, Navigate to your <strong>Organization Settings</strong> Page on the left-hand side of the dashboard.<br><br>Under the <strong>Overview</strong> section, there are options to manage <strong>Technical Contacts</strong> and <strong>Security Contacts.<br><br></strong>Within each respective section, there is a button to add a contact. <br><br><em><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Note:</span> There is a limit of 5 Emails for these contacts. If the limit is reached, there will be a banner instructing users to remove emails before others can be added.</em></p>
<p><em>We encourage using mailing groups and managing user contacts via the mailing group to reach the most people within your organization without exceeding the maximum allotted email contacts per organization</em></p>
