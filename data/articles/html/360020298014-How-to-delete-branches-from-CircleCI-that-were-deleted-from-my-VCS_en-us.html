<p data-renderer-start-pos="6586">CircleCI automatically deletes branches when we receive a branch deletion event from your VCS provider (GitHub / Bitbucket). For various reasons, this may become out of sync.</p>

    <li>
        <p data-renderer-start-pos="6878">Push the same branch name up to your VCS provider</p>
    </li>

        <p data-renderer-start-pos="6888">Run the deletion one again to retrigger the deletion</p>
    </li>

<h2><strong><span>Additional Notes</span></strong></h2>
<p> If you attempt to delete a branch while a job connected to that branch is still running, the branch will be re-created in CircleCI when the job is finished. Please allow all jobs running on a branch to finish before deleting them from the VCS provider to assure they will stay deleted. </p>
