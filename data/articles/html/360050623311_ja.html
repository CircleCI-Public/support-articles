<p>2020年11月1日から Docker Hub では送信元のIPに基づいたレート制限（アクセス回数による制限）が導入されます。 <span>However, CircleCI has partnered with Docker to ensure that our users can continue to access Docker Hub without rate limits. On November 1st, with few exceptions<strong>*</strong> (listed below), you should not be impacted by any rate limits when pulling images from Docker Hub through CircleCI.</span></p>
<p><span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span><span>However, these rate limits may go into effect for CircleCI users in the future. That’s why we’re encouraging you and your team to add Docker Hub authentication to your CircleCI configuration and consider upgrading your Docker Hub plan, as appropriate, to prevent any impact from rate limits in the future.</span></p>
<p>We have additional information and up to date details on the <a href="https://discuss.circleci.com/t/authenticate-with-docker-to-avoid-impact-of-nov-1st-rate-limits/37567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Authenticate with Docker to avoid impact of Nov. 1st rate limits" Discuss post</a>.</p>
<p><strong>*Exceptions: Remote Docker and Machine Executors will be impacted by the rate limiting unless pulling CircleCI-published images.</strong></p>
<p>Below we will describe frequently asked questions on how this affects your CircleCI jobs and how to handle each situation. This change does affect both Cloud and Enterprise CircleCI customers.</p>
<h2>どうやって Docker Hubで認証しますか？</h2>
<p>You will need to pass an <code>auth</code> key with your Docker image and utilize a username and password. Specific steps can be found here: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/private-images/">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/private-images/</a> </p>
<h2>どうやって認証が成功したか確認できますか？</h2>
<p>If you have passed the <code>auth</code> key on your Docker pulls and the pulls continue to be successful, such as on the "Spin up environment" step, your credentials are being successfully used. At this time we don't have a way to see in the UI the authenticated credentials.</p>
<p>However, if you are passing the key and the wrong credentials are set, <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050931691-Docker-Error-response-from-daemon-unauthorized-incorrect-username-or-password" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you will receive an error and the build will fail. </a></p>
<p>Note: CircleCi shows the <strong>warning message</strong> in the spin up environment step if you have not added <code>auth</code> key yet.</p>
<p>&gt;Warning: No authentication provided, this pull may be subject to rate limits.</p>

<h2>ビルドでDocker executorを利用している場合は影響を受けますか？</h2>
<p>No, as mentioned previously <span>CircleCI has partnered with Docker to ensure that our users can continue to access Docker Hub without rate limits.</span></p>
<p><span>However, these rate limits may go into effect for CircleCI users in the future. That’s why we’re encouraging you and your team to add Docker Hub authentication to your CircleCI configuration and consider upgrading your Docker Hub plan, as appropriate, to prevent any impact from rate limits in the future.</span></p>
<p><span>As mentioned in the exceptions section though, the use of Remote Docker with a non-CircleCI convenience image is affected by these rate limits and you will want to ensure you authenticate.</span></p>
<h2>ビルドでMachine executorを利用している場合は影響を受けますか？</h2>
<p>Maybe, if you utilize Docker (i.e. pull images) within your <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#machine-executor-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine executor</a> jobs this could affect you. As mentioned in the above exceptions, if you are using a non-CircleCI image you will be impacted.</p>
<p>You will need to use the <code>docker login -u username -p password</code> command with your credentials to log in to Docker Hub, before running the docker commands that potentially pull images; such as, <code>docker pull</code>, <code>docker run</code>, or <code>docker build</code>.</p>
<h2>CircleCIのコンビニエンスイメージを利用している場合、影響はありますか？</h2>
<p>No, as mentioned previously <span>CircleCI has partnered with Docker to ensure that our users can continue to access Docker Hub without rate limits.</span></p>
<p><span>However, these rate limits may go into effect for CircleCI users in the future. That’s why we’re encouraging you and your team to add Docker Hub authentication to your CircleCI configuration and consider upgrading your Docker Hub plan, as appropriate, to prevent any impact from rate limits in the future.</span></p>
<h2>カスタムDockerイメージを使用する場合、影響はありますか？</h2>
<p>If the custom Docker images are being used in a Remote Docker or Machine executor, yes, they are affected.</p>
<p>However, custom docker images used with the Docker executor won't be affected because of the previously mentioned partnership.</p>
<p>Although, <span>these rate limits may go into effect for CircleCI users in the future and we are still encouraging users to authenticate. </span></p>
<h2><span>I use CircleCI Enterprise (Server), does this affect me?</span></h2>
<p><span>Yes -- this change affects both Cloud and Enterprise CircleCI customers.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The pulls of <code class="c-mrkdwn__code" data-stringify-type="code">circleci</code> and <code class="c-mrkdwn__code" data-stringify-type="code">cimg</code> images are exempt from the rate limit even for customers outside of the CircleCI environment. <span class="c-mrkdwn__br" data-stringify-type="paragraph-break"></span>However, it still makes sense for <span class="c-mrkdwn__mention">Server</span> customers to authenticate with their Docker Hub accounts (through proxy or otherwise) as they probably also pull other, non-CircleCI images from Docker Hub.</span></p>
<p><span>Server customers can set up a Docker Hub pull through registry mirror pre-configured with Docker Hub account credentials. <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-hub-pull-through-mirror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Know more</a>!</span></p>
<h2>What actions can I take ahead of November 1st, 2020?</h2>
<p>Depending on your CircleCI setup, you may not need to take action. Please reference the other FAQ sections to see if rate limiting will be applied to your builds.</p>
<p>If you do need to take action, it would be to set up Docker authentication in your projects, we have more information on those actions in the <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049758552-My-build-fails-to-pull-Docker-image-with-Too-Many-Requests-Rate-Limiting-by-Docker-Hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"My build fails to pull Docker image with "Too Many Requests" - Rate Limiting by Docker Hub" article</a>. </p>
<h2>Can I update all of my projects that require Docker authentication en masse?</h2>
<p>At the moment each project will need to be updated individually.</p>
<h2>If I am blocked after the change happens, what actions can I take?</h2>
<p>If you haven't set up the authentication described above, that would be the first step.</p>
<p>If you have set up authentication and hit the limits, you will either want to change how often you are building or explore Docker Hub's plans that allow for unlimited pulls.</p>
<h2>How can I authenticate on OSS projects?</h2>
<p>If the OSS projects utilize machine and remote docker you can add some conditional logic that will authenticate based on the users access levels:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">- run:     name: Docker Hub login if available    command: |      if [ -n "$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" ]; then        docker login --username $DOCKERHUB_USERNAME --password $DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD      else        echo "Docker Hub credentials unavailable, pulling anonymously"      fi</pre>
<p>With the above, you would store the username and password either in a context or as project-level environment variables. For users who have access to the main repository as a collaborator, their builds will authenticate with the credentials stored. For someone who submits a forked PR to the project, and if the project has "pass secrets to forked pull requests" turned off, the pull/push would be done anonymously. </p>
