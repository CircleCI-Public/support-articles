<h3>If you are seeing commits show up as the wrong user, you may need to change the email associated with your commit.</h3>
<h4>Per <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-commits-linked-to-the-wrong-user/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub's Article</a>: </h4>
<blockquote>GitHub uses the email address in the commit header to link the commit to a GitHub user. If your commits are being linked to another user, or not linked to a user at all, you may need to change your local Git configuration settings, add an email address to your account email settings, or do both.</blockquote>
