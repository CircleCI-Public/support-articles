<p><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Layer Caching (DLC)</a> can reduce Docker image build times on CircleCI. Some frequently asked questions around DLC are:</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>Is DLC available between different workflows under the same project?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">Yes, DLC is not locked to workflows or jobs. You can create a maximum of 50 DLC volumes per project.</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>Why are subsequent builds not able to access the cache consistently?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">If a job fails while calling a specific DLC volume, it would require rebuilding when calling it again, causing inconsistencies. It is worth noting that different jobs may also use different volumes. An example being if two<span> </span><code>machine</code><span> </span>jobs are run in parallel, they <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/docker-layer-caching/#how-dlc-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will get different DLC volumes</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>Is DLC guaranteed? </strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">Unfortunately, DLC is not guaranteed. <span>If you are experiencing issues with cache-misses or need high-parallelism, consider trying the official CircleCI Partner Docker Orb</span><span> </span><a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/docker#commands-build" rel="noreferrer">circleci/docker orb</a>.</p>
<h3 dir="auto"><strong>As an admin, can I see the content of a DLC volume?</strong></h3>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent3" dir="auto">While you can see what volume is used for each job, at this time, the content is unavailable.</p>
