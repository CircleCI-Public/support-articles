<h1>Timing Data</h1>
<p>Debugging where jobs spend most of their time can be useful in optimizing your pipeline, along with debugging spikes in job completion time.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Generally, logging timing data is up to the command that is being run at the time, but we can manually add this by using some bash scripting.</p>
<p>See the following example:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">- run: example_command | while read line; do echo "$(date +%T) &gt; $line"; done;</pre>
<p>This will provide an output along the following lines:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">21:15:46 &gt; Some Output Line 1
21:16:12 &gt; Some Output Line 2
21:17:41 &gt; Some Output Line 3
</pre>
<p>The format of the timing data is in <code>HH:MM:SS</code>, which provides granular information that will help track down steps that are taking longer than expected.</p>
