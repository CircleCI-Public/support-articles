<p>First, check that your password and username are indeed correct. If so, check with your CircleCI account team on the timeline for renewal of the licensing used for your Server install. </p>
<p><br>You may need to install the new license and <span>use a new Azure ACR token/password (K8s Registry Credential) and update this license in your helm value file followed by a helm deployment.</span></p>
