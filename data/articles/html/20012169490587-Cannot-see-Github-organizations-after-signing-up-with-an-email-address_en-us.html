<p data-pm-slice='1 1 ["orderedList",{"order":1},"listItem",null]'>If you already have an account on CircleCI that is integrated with Github and you sign up with an email and connect your Github account, you might find that you cannot see the same organizations that you previously had access to on your account.<br><br>The reason for this is that the "old" and "new" accounts have different integrations to Github. Starting August 2023, when a CircleCI account is authorized with GitHub, the integration will be done through <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/github-apps-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our GitHub App</a>, rather than the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/github-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub OAuth app</a>.</p>

        <p data-renderer-start-pos="7742">If you need to be able to access organizations with both Github OAuth and Github Apps integrations from the same account, you can connect your Github OAuth user to your "new" account:</p>
        <ul class="ak-ul" data-indent-level="1">
            <li>First, you will need to disconnect your GitHub OAuth user from its previous CircleCI account by going to the Account Integrations section on the <a href="http://%20https//app.circleci.com/settings/user" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">User Settings page</a>.</li>
            <li>Once this is done, you will be able to connect the Github OAuth user to your "new" account from the <a href="http://%20https//app.circleci.com/settings/user" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">User Settings page</a> after logging in with the new account.</li>
