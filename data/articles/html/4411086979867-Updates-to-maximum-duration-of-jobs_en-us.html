<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximum Runtime</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the changes to our pricing plans, jobs will have their maximum runtime durations updated to the following:<br></span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour (for Free plan)</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 hours (for Performance plan)</span></li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">5 hours (for Scale plan)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reasoning</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From our research, 99.7% of jobs on the Performance plan finished within three hours, while 99.6% of jobs on the Free plan finished before the one-hour mark. Reducing the max runtime duration for jobs enables us to reduce our infrastructure cost for CircleCI Cloud. We are passing these savings on to our customers in the form of increased access to features and a lower plan starting cost.</span></p>
