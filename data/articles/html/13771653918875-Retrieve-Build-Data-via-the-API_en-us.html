<h1 id="h_01HYB63QNSAW6SZXHEG3BD1XB0">Overview:</h1>
<p class="p1">Typically, build data will disappear after a set amount of time, based on your organization's plan. But what if I need data that is outside of my organization's plan? The CircleCI v2 API contains endpoints that will help retrieve build data on a regular basis so you can keep records going forward.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HYB63QNSC3DCT3HYDJDB6RDG" class="p1">Steps to Retrieve Data:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Retrieve a list of pipelines for a given project:<a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/listPipelinesForProject" target="_self"> Get all pipelines </a>
    </li>
    <li>Retrieve a list of workflows for a given pipeline by the pipeline ID: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/listWorkflowsByPipelineId" target="_self" rel="undefined">Get a pipeline’s workflows</a>
    </li>
    <li>Retrieve the workflow data by the workflow ID: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/getWorkflowById" target="_self">Get a workflow by ID</a>
    </li>
    <li>Retrieve the jobs of a workflow by the workflow ID: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/index.html#operation/listWorkflowJobs" target="_self">Get a workflow’s jobs</a>
    </li>
    <li>Store the retrieved pipeline, workflow, and job data in your chosen data stores</li>
    <li>Repeat steps as required with the <code>next_page_token</code> response from step 1</li>
</ol>
<p class="p2">To expedite to process, we would recommend performing these steps in a script that can be reused and modified to suit your needs.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HYB6414B2EE5792C15BXTM7V" class="undefined">Limitations:</h2>
<p>While this method may allow you to get build data that is outside of your retention period, it will not be able to get <em>all </em>build data for a project that is outside of your plan's retention period. This is why we recommend that users regularly retrieve their build data and store it securely.</p>
