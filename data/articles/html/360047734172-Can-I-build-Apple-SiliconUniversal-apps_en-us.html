<p>Yes! Xcode 12 ships with both Intel and Apple Silicon tooling, so you can use our Xcode 12 image to build Intel, Apple Silicon and Universal apps.</p>
<p>There are a few caveats to note:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Compilation times for Apple Silicon will be elevated due to the overheads of cross-compiling.</li>
    <li>Testing Apple Silicon apps is not possible as our fleet is entirely comprised of Intel Macs</li>
</ul>
<p>CircleCI is planning to add Apple Silicon hosts to out fleet in the future, however we do not have an ETA for this.</p>
