<p>Generally speaking, Orbs will have their source code available on GitHub, or another git hosting service such as BitBucket or GitLab, which will be linked from the registry page. Not all Orbs are written and maintained by CircleCI, so getting involved with the Orb's own repository is recommended and encouraged!</p>
<p>You can find the source link by navigating to the orbs page from the <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs" target="_self" rel="undefined">CircleCI Orbs Registry</a> and click the link under "source". </p>
<p>If the source link is not available, feel free to open a ticket so we can either get in touch with the original author or provide a link to the repository.</p>
