<p>If you are experiencing AWS authentication errors despite having provided the correct AWS credentials in your project or context environment variables (e.g. <em>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</em>, <em>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</em> or other means as documented <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, this may be caused by AWS credentials previously set for the project in a legacy settings page.</p>
