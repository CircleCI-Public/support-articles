<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>Sometimes there are breaking changes made by updates to the <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-elastic-beanstalk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circleci/aws-elastic-beanstalk</a> orb. Currently, v<span>3.20.5 of the Elastic Beanstalk CLI contains changes that are incompatible with CircleCI's architecture. This means that the orbs like our <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-elastic-beanstalk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circleci/aws-elastic-beanstalk</a> orb will not work until a new update is pushed because the orb pulls from the latest version.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>Solution:</span></h2>
<p>While an update on our end should be out shortly to address the issue with the orb, this still means that v3.20.5 does not work with CircleCI. As a workaround, we would recommend creating commands that will emulate the function of the orb, while installing the most recently compatible version of the EB CLI (v3.20.3). For example, these commands could be added to your config and modified as needed to suit your environment:</p>
