<h1>Viewing Network Ingress and Egress</h1>
<p>You can view d<span>etails of your organization's network transfer and storage usage on your Plan &gt; Plan Usage screen. In addition, you can <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/persist-data/#managing-network-and-storage-usage" target="_self" rel="undefined">find out more about how to manage your network and storage costs here</a>.</span><br><br>However, you may like to determine the network transfer (ingress and egress) of a specific build. This may be useful for your team, in order to diagnose which processes in the build may be consuming high network transfer usage for instance.<br><br>For Docker-based jobs, you can<a href="https://circleci.com/blog/network-transfer-ip-ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> inspect the overall network transfer under the </a><span><a href="https://circleci.com/blog/network-transfer-ip-ranges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Network transfer</strong> section of the <strong>Resources</strong> tab.</a><br><br><img src="https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/8481733535131/2022-03-16-network-transfer-screenshot.png" alt="2022-03-16-network-transfer-screenshot.png"><br><br><br></span>Additionally, you can also inspect the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/proc.html#id15" target="_self">networking information, particularly from `/proc/net/dev`</a>, before and after a command is executed.<br>This is useful in estimating the network transfer from a specific command, </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Extending on the method above, <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/nanophate/docker-profiling" target="_self">here is an example Orb that will calculate the stats in a readable format</a>. We can see it in action with an example screenshot below:</p>

<p>To illustrate how to use <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/nanophate/docker-profiling#commands-network" target="_self">the <code>network</code> command of this Orb</a>, you can set up your config file like this to see how many bytes are transmitted and received for a cURL request, for example:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><span class="hljs-attr">version:</span><span> </span><span>'2.1'<br></span><br><span class="hljs-attr">orbs:<br></span><span class="hljs-attr">  profiling:</span> nanophate/docker-profiling@0.3.0<br><br>jobs:<br><span>  build</span>:<br>    docker:<br>      - image: cimg/base:stable<br>  steps:<br>    <span>- checkout<br></span><span>    - profiling/network</span><br><br></pre>
<p><br><strong>NOTE:</strong> Your overall <strong>Network Transfer</strong> amount is not representative of your billable usage. Only certain actions will result in network egress, which in turn results in billable usage.
