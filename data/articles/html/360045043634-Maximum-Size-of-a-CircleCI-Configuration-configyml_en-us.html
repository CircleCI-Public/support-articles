<p>The maximum size of a CircleCI configuration file(config.yml) is 3MB. When this limit is exceeded, customers may see bug such as "<strong>Unexpected exception processing config"</strong> or "<strong>An compiled config YAML must be at most 3MB"</strong> or "<strong><span>Error: Your config (including expanded orbs) is too large. Please contact support."</span></strong> in their build logs</p>
<p>It is important to remember that this is the <em>compiled</em> configuration. This is the result of expanding any YAML anchors and aliases as well as expanding any included Orbs.</p>
