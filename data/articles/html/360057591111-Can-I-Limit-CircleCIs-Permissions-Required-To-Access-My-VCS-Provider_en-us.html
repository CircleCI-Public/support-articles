<h1>CircleCI Permissions</h1>
<p>CircleCI only ever requests the minimum possible required permissions.</p>
<p>It is currently not possible to limit the required permissions for CircleCI to access your VCS provider account any further whilst retaining full functionality. This is due to CircleCI being bound by the specific permissions models for GitHub and Bitbucket, as they do not provide<span> granular permissions to limit scope.</span></p>
<p><span>We always encourage users with concerns about the permission models to reach out to GitHub and Bitbucket directly in the hope they will be updated in the future.</span></p>
