<p data-renderer-start-pos="7337"><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching">Caching</a> is a good strategy for optimizing jobs on CircleCI as it enables the reusing of the data from expensive fetch operations from previous jobs.</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="7337">However, cache hits are not guaranteed; caches created via the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#save_cache">save_cache</a> step are only stored for up to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/#managing-caches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 days</a>.</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="7337">Hence if you're writing your jobs in a way that they fail or do the wrong thing when there's a cache miss, consider improving them to be resilient to a cache miss.</p>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="7432">Solutions:</p>
<ul class="ak-ul" data-indent-level="1">
    <li>
        <p data-renderer-start-pos="7446">Make sure that a job that makes use of cached dependencies should be written such that it would be able to do a fresh fetch of the required dependencies upon a cache miss</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="7610">Your jobs should not fail due to dependency changes or when caches expire.</p>
