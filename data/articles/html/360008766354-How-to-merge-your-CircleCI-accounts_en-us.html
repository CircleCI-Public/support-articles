<p>When you sign in to CircleCI, you can do this either with your email address or with one selected VCS provider (example: Github).</p>
<p>If you signed up with your email, you will be offered the option to connect your Github or Bitbucket user to your CircleCI account. If you signed up with a VCS provider, you will be able to add additional account integrations (example: BitBucket) on your account's page here: <a href="https://app.circleci.com/settings/user">https://app.circleci.com/settings/user</a>.</p>
<p>If you have already linked or signed up with a VCS user to CircleCI previously and are trying to connect this same user to another account, you will see the following error:</p>
<p><em>We encountered a problem adding your identity to CircleCI... The identity provided by your VCS service is already associated with a different account. Please try logging in using that account or contact us for further help.</em></p>
<p>If you receive this error, please <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact Support</a> and we will help you unlink the user from your previous account, so they may be rejoined as you wish.</p>
