<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>You may have situations where a specific workflow in one of your projects should trigger a new build in a different project. As an example, maybe an update to your <code>blog</code> project needs to kick off a new build in your <code>website</code> project to ensure everything is up to date.</p>
<h2><span>Adding a step to trigger a pipeline in a different project</span></h2>
<p>You can accomplish this via a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run step</a> that sends an API call to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#trigger-a-new-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trigger a new pipeline</a>. You will want to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate a personal API token</a> and store it as an <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">environment variable</a> within the project the run step will be on.</p>
<p>Then once that is done you will add this run step to your config of that project:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">- run:
  name: Kick off new pipeline
  command: |
    curl --location --request POST 'https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/(vcs)/(org)/(project)/pipeline' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -u "${API_TOKEN}:"</pre>
<p>In the above snippet, you will need to update <code>(vcs)</code> to <code>github</code> or <code>bitbucket</code>, <code>(org)</code> to your Organization, and <code>(project)</code> to the name of your project.</p>
<p>Once this has been done once the first project reaches the run step above it will start the second pipeline automatically as long as the settings are correct including the <code>API_TOKEN</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOTE: You will receive a "project not found" response from the CircleCI API endpoint if the user token does not have the correct permissions or has not been added as an environment variable </strong></p>
<p> </p>
