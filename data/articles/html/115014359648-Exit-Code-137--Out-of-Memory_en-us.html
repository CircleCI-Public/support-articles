<h1>Exit Code 137 - Out of memory</h1>
<p>This is a <strong>Linux error code</strong> which you may see on CircleCI when your container runs out of memory. Containers are given 4GB of RAM by default. If your build process consumes all of the container memory, your build will fail.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://circleci.com/pricing/usage/" target="_self">Performance Plan</a>, you can use the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource_class" target="_self"><em>resource_class</em></a> configuration option to control the available resources for your build containers. </p>
<p>Sometimes, tools that automatically spawn workers, processes, or threads based on CPU count can inadvertently cause memory issues on CircleCI, and require manual config when running in the CI environment.
