<p>If you subscribed to SMS text message alerts on our <a href="https://status.circleci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status page</a>, you can unsubscribe from them by replying "STOP".Â </p>
<p>From <a href="https://help.statuspage.io/knowledge_base/topics/email-and-sms-notifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StatusPage help</a>:</p>
<blockquote>End-users can unsubscribe from SMS notifications by replying STOP. (Note: some international carriers don't play nice with sending "STOP" messages, which may require those numbers to be unsubscribed through the UI by a Statuspage admin/team member).</blockquote>
<p>If the "STOP" command does not work, please contact us by opening a <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_self">support ticket</a>.</p>
