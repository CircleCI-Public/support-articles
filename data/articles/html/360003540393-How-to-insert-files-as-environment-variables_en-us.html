<h1>Inserting files with Base64</h1>
<p>If you need to insert sensitive text-based documents or even small binary files into your project in secret, it is possible to insert them as an environment variable by leveraging base64 encoding.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Base64</a> is an encoding scheme to translate binary data into text strings. These values can be added to <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a context</a> or inserted as <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an environment variable</a> and decoded at runtime.</p>
<h2>Encoding your file</h2>
<p>You can encode a file via your command line terminal by feeding it directly to base64.</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">base64 [option] [file]</pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are encoding a file (whether it be a large file or a "binary") for use as a CircleCI environment variable, you should pass the <code>-w 0</code> option to the command so newlines aren't present in the resulting base64, which will be converted to spaces when added to CircleCI.</p>
<h2>Adding your file as an environment variable</h2>
<p>You can add the newly encoded file as an environment variable to your project or as a context, depending on your preference.</p>
<p>Environment variables can be configured in the UI under "Project Settings":</p>

<p>Contexts can be configured under "Organization Settings":</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Decoding your file within your container</h2>
<p>To decode the base64 file from within your container you can use the <code>--decode</code> option.</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">base64 --decode [file]</pre>
<p>If your file is stored as an environment variable, you can pipe it directly to the base64 command to be decoded, storing the result in a file:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><span class="pl-c1">echo</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span><span class="pl-smi">$ENV_VARIABLE_NAME</span><span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> <span class="pl-k">|</span> base64 --decode <span class="pl-k">&gt;</span> filename.txt</pre>
<p>If your file is stored as a context, you will also need to a<span>dd the context to your workflows </span><span>for the job in which you want to decode your file.</span></p>
