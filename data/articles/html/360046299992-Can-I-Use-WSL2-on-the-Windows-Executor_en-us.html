<h1>Nested Virtualization Not Supported</h1>
<p>Our <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/android-machine-image#:~:text=Android%20machine%20image%20supports%20nested%20virtualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android image</a> does have support for nested virtualization, but all other execution environments do not. Meaning our Windows hosts do not support nested virtualization at this current time and you will not be able to use Windows Subsystem for Linux or WSL 2.</p>
