<p><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">To submit a deletion request, please open a ticket with our support team via the <a href="https://support.circleci.com/">Support Center.</a> <br><br>In the ticket, </span>please provide the following details:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Organization Name (case-sensitive)</li>
    <li>VCS provider (if it is GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitlab, etc)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a request is received, you can expect our agents to ask for confirmation of your request. <br><br></p>
<p>CircleCI will <em>only</em> approve deletion requests made by organization admins.<strong><br>Please ensure you have <em>not</em> disconnected your org from CircleCI before submitting a request, otherwise our Support agents will not be able to verify your admin status directly.<br><br></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Please understand that the deletion of your organization can take up to several hours.<br>This depends on the total number of builds made under the organization.<br><br></p>
<h2 id="important" class="p1">Important: After Deletion is Complete</h2>
<p>Our agents will inform you once the organization account is deleted.<br>Please be aware that, this organization account can <strong>still</strong> show up on the left navigation bar on our UI.</p>
<p>This is because when a user logs in to CircleCI, CircleCI looks up all their linked organizations in the user's connected VCS account (e.g., GitHub), and <em>recreates</em> them if not found.</p>
<p>Please note that the original organization account was deleted, and <strong>all build histories are removed.</strong><br>This newly-created organization account does not have any build history<strong>,</strong> and has a different organization ID.<br><br>Please update your organization's repositories to prevent them from further building on CircleCI.<br>You would want to:</p>
