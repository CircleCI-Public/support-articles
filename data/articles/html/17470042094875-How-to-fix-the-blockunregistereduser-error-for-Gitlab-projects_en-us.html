<p><span>When you sign up to CircleCI with your email address, you can accept an invite to a Gitlab project, you will be able to view and follow the project and trigger builds as long as builds are not restricted to registered users. However, if you have not connected your Gitlab user to your CircleCI account upon sign-up, you will not be considered a registered user of the organization and our system will prevent you from triggering a build when the <code>Prevent unregistered user spend</code> feature is enabled.</span></p>

<p><span>Once this is done, you will be able to set up your own project, if you wish to do so or you can cancel adding a project. At this point, your user will be a registered Gitlab user and you will be able to trigger builds.</span><span></span></p>
