<h1>Secret Masking</h1>
<p>CircleCI has a secret masking feature to help keep environment variables private and this feature automatically masks environment variables that are written to the build log. The support team is able to disable this feature on a per-project basis. An org admin can open a <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support ticket</a> to request this action to be taken.</p>
