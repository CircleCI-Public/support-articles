<p>You may have a use case for creating a new commit and pushing it to the same repository as part of your CircleCI job.</p>
<h2>Configuration Steps </h2>
<p>Here is how you can configure your CircleCI project to enable the above-mentioned use case.</p>
<p>1) Decide if you wish to configure the project with a user key generated by CircleCI or a manually-created read-write deployment key</p>
<p>1a) If you wish to use a user key, simply visit <a href="https://app.circleci.com/settings/project/:vcs-type/:org-name/:project-name/ssh" target="_self">https://app.circleci.com/settings/project/:vcs-type/:org-name/:project-name/ssh</a><a href="https://circleci.com/:vcs-type/:org-name/:project-name/edit#checkout"> </a>and click on the "Authorize with GitHub" button.</p>
<p>1b) If you wish to use a read-write deployment key, follow the steps here to create it and configure the project so that the key has write permissions for it: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#creating-a-github-user-key">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#creating-a-github-user-key</a> or <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#creating-a-bitbucket-user-key">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/gh-bb-integration/#creating-a-bitbucket-user-key</a> for Bitbucket users</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Common Issues:</h2>
<p>1) "*** Please tell me who you are." error message upon running "git commit"</p>
<p>In your CircleCI configuration file (config.yml), you might have to add commands to configure an email and user name with `git config` prior to running `git commit`, e.g.</p>
<pre>git config user.email "username@mydomain.com"<br>git config user.name "My Name"</pre>
<p><br>2) Running git push results in "ERROR: The key you are authenticating with has been marked as read only."</p>
<p>The deploy key that the project is configured with, by default when you add a project on CircleCI, only has read access, so a key with write permissions needs to be configured to be used, to avoid the above error message. Please ensure that a user key or a read-write deployment key has been configured for the project (See "Configuration Steps" above).</p>
<p>If you are using a read-write deployment key, please add an <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#add_ssh_keys">add_ssh_keys</a> step to your configuration. The fingerprints value should match what is shown on <a href="https://circleci.com/:vcs-type/:org-name/:project-name/edit#checkout">https://circleci.com/:vcs-type/:org-name/:project-name/edit#ssh</a></p>

<p>3) How to stop your generated commits from triggering new builds</p>
<p>To prevent a commit from triggering a new build, add "[skip ci]" to the commit message. For more details, see: <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/skip-build/#skipping-a-build">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/skip-build/#skipping-a-build</a></p>
