<p>If you are <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/private-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authenticating when pulling Docker images</a> and receive an error like the following on your "Spin up environment" step:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/360072462692/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_12.45.28_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_12.45.28_PM.png"></p>
<p>It means the username or password you are passing for authentication is incorrect. If you are passing them in as environment variables like the following:</p>
<pre>jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/android:api-29-node
        auth:
          username: $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME
          password: $DOCKER_HUB_PASSWORD</pre>
<p>You will want to ensure they are correct in your <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project</a> or <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener">context variable</a> settings. Docker Hub allows you to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create and utilize access tokens</a>, so if you are using one of those it could be it was disabled or deleted a new one will need to be set. </p>
