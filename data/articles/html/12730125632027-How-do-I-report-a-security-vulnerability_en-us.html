<p class="bold">If you find a serious security issue such as any of the following issues, please <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact us</a> with relevant details including steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept.</p>
<ul class="green-circles no-offset">
    <li>Injection vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Authentication or session problems</li>
    <li>Improper access to sensitive data</li>
    <li>Broken access controls</li>
    <li>Cross-site scripting</li>
    <li>Anything from the OWASP Top 10 Project</li>

    </li>
    <li>Email spoofing, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC errors</li>
</ul>
<p class="bold">Upon discovering a vulnerability, we ask that you act in a way to protect our users' data:</p>
<ul class="green-circles no-offset">
    <li>Inform us as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>Test against fake data and accounts, not our users' private data (please ask if you'd like a free account to work on this).</li>
    <li>Work with us to close the vulnerability before disclosing it to others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01GX6XC894Y4E8CA4GH32FZ5MH">Bug Bounties</h2>
<p>If you have found a bug in production, we hope you share this information with us to help improve the security of the broader internet ecosystem.</p>
<p>CircleCI does <em>not</em> have a bug bounty program, and as such, does not issue bounties for bug reports. We do not offer payments for reporting vulnerabilities. </p>
<p>In the event that a valuable novel discovery is uncovered, CircleCI agents may offer <strong>one</strong> bundle of swag as a reward at their discretion. We do not provide custom orders or fulfill specific requests. </p>
