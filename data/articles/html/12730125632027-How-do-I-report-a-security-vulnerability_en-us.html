<ul class="green-circles no-offset">
    <li>Inform us as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>Test against fake data and accounts, not our users' private data (please ask if you'd like a free account to work on this).</li>
    <li>Work with us to close the vulnerability before disclosing it to others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="01GX6XC894Y4E8CA4GH32FZ5MH">Bug Bounties</h2>
<p>If you have found a bug in production, we hope you share this information with us to help improve the security of the broader internet ecosystem.</p>
<p>CircleCI does <em>not</em> have a bug bounty program, and as such, does not issue bounties for bug reports. We do not offer payments for reporting vulnerabilities.Â </p>
