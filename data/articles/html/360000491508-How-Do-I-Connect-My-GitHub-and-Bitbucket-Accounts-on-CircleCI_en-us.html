    <li>If you are <strong>not already logged into</strong> your secondary VCS account, you'll be redirected to the VCS website to authenticate and authorize CircleCI.</li>
    <li>If you <strong>are already logged into</strong> your secondary VCS account, it will be added to your existing CircleCI account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this is done, the "<em><strong>organization picker</strong></em>" will also list the organizations available to the secondary VCS account.</p>
<p>Next to each organization's name you'll see either a <code>GH</code> or <code>BB</code> badge indicating whether an organization is associated with GitHub or Bitbucket.</p>
