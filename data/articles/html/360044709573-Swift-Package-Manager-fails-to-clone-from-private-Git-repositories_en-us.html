<p dir="auto">If you are using Swift Package Manager as part of the <code>xcodebuild</code> process, you may find that this fails with the following error message:</p>
<pre class="output"><span class="pre"><span class="white">xcodebuild: error: Could not resolve package dependencies:
  Authentication failed because the credentials were rejected</span></span></pre>
<p dir="auto">Or</p>
<pre class="css-9561s5">xcodebuild: error: Could not resolve package dependencies:
  The server SSH fingerprint failed to verify.
</pre>
<p dir="auto">This issue will only occur when trying to access private git repos when using SSH key authentication.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is caused by a bug in the way that <code>xcodebuild</code> handles SSH keys and has been a known bug since the debut of Xcode 11, occurring both locally, but more specifically, in a CI environment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>xcodebuild</code> does not conform to the system ssh config and does not access the keys CircleCI stores in <code>ssh-agent</code>. We can work around this by requesting Xcode uses the main system version of ssh which will behave as expected.</p>
<p dir="auto">The workaround for this is to add the following lines to your config file, directly after the <code>checkout</code> step:</p>
