<h2>Set unsafe-perm param</h2>

<p>This solution has setting <code style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">unsafe-perm</code> to true:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">npm install puppeteer --unsafe-perm=true </pre>
<h2>Download Chromium Directly</h2>
<p>To allow for more control over where and how you are downloading Chromium, you can download it directly. You could even implement a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42873285/curl-retry-mechanism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retry functionality into your cURL</a> to ensure you get it downloaded.</p>
<p>Then you would utilize <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#environment-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppeteers Environment Variables</a> to skip the Chromium download and point it to where you manually downloaded Chromium.</p>
