<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We do not have a direct endpoint for collecting this information, but you can often derive it from the `me` endpoint:</p>
<p>https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me</p>
<p>This shows data from the currently logged-in user, or simply the user of the `circle-token` provided. If you use a token, be sure to make use of a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/" target="_self">Personal API Token</a> as opposed to a Project Token.</p>
<p>Within that API response, you will find the `projects` property. This will be a list of projects. The JSON object key will be the VCS URL. You can use that to filter to projects specifically within the desired organization.</p>
