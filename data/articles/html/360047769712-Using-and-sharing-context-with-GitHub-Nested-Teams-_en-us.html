<p>Nested teams within GitHub do not automatically inherit a parent team's context permissions.</p>
<p>If a parent team is selected as a security group for a context, child teams are <strong>not</strong> automatically granted access.</p>
<p>If a child team is not listed as a security group you will get an "Unauthorized" error when triggering a build in CircleCI's UI please see the screenshot below for an example.</p>

<p>In order to grant a GitHub child team access to context, you will need to add the team as a security group for the context.</p>
<p>For more information on contexts please refer to our official documentation:  <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/" target="_self">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/</a></p>
