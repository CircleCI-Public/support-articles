<h1>Options for Storing Secrets</h1>
<p>There are few secret-storage options that CircleCI can support at this time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can store them as plaintext using <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts" rel="nofollow">Contexts</a> resources (org-wide) or <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars" rel="nofollow">environment variables</a> (job-specific), and then <code>echo</code> them into files, etc., at job runtime via your config.yml</li>
    <li>You can encrypt files and store them in your source repository, but store the decryption keys in CircleCI, again either via Contexts or job environment variables, and then decrypt as-needed at job runtime</li>
    <li>You can use a third-party secret storage solution (for example, <a href="https://vaultproject.io/" rel="nofollow">Hashicorp's Vault</a>), so long as it has a headless CLI-accessible option that you can use in your CircleCI job (which Vault does)</li>
</ul>
