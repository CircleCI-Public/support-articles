<h1>CircleCI was unable to execute the job to completion, because the CircleCI runner received a kill signal midway through the job.</h1>
<p>When running your jobs in CircleCI, you may encounter this error causing your builds to not complete, almost randomly. </p>
<p>This error can also be in combination with <code>CircleCI received exit
        code 1</code> or <code>CircleCI received exit code 137</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>Step 1</span></h2>
<p><span>These exit codes and errors typically go in combination with resource constraints. Please take a look at the <a href="https://discuss.circleci.com/t/product-launch-resources-tab-now-shows-resource-utilization-for-machine-jobs/45359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resource tab</a> on your job's page.</span></p>

<p><span>If your graph looks similar to this, please consider upgrading your <a href="https://circleci.com/product/features/resource-classes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resource class</a> to a larger one.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>Step 2</span></h2>
<p><span>If you are continuing to see resource class exhaustion during your build, and you are testing your application, you may take a look at <code>test splitting</code> which involves splitting your tests up to separate containers which can reduce resource usage and even speed up your tests.</span></p>
