<h3>Your build and tests may run more slowly on CircleCI than on a local developer machine. </h3>
<p>This can be due to the executor being used (i.e. Docker vs Machine), along with shared resources vs dedicated hardware. </p>
<p>To offer a cost-effective service, all standard builds run with 2 CPU cores and 4GB RAM.</p>
<h2>How to speed up builds and tests</h2>
<h3>Parallel jobs</h3>
<p>You can split your tests to run in parallel in multiple containers using parallelism and test splitting.</p>

<h3>Resource Class</h3>
<p>Customers on different CircleCI Plans can utilize other resource classes that give you more CPU power or RAM. Available resource classes can be found <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource_class" target="_self">in our docs</a>.</p>
