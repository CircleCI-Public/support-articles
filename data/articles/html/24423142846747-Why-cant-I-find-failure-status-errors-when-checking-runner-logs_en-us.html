<p>If a container-runner task is claimed but does not start within ~10 minutes, it is expected behavior for the pod to time out and you will receive a "infrastructure failure" error. You will not see any failures in your logs, as the pod did not start.</p>
<p>In this case, we recommend inspecting the output in the Task lifecycle step and running the following command: </p>
<pre>kubectl describe pod -n circleci &lt; full pod name &gt;</pre>
