<h1>Exceeding 4MB Max Config Size</h1>
<p>The maximum size of a CircleCI configuration file (config.yml) is 4MB. When this limit is exceeded, customers may see errors such as "<strong>Unexpected exception processing config"</strong> or "<strong>A compiled config YAML must be at most 4MB"</strong> or <strong>"Your compiled config is too large to be processed. Please contact support.<span>"</span></strong> in their build logs.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that this is the <em>compiled</em> configuration. This is the result of expanding any YAML anchors and aliases as well as importing all required/imported orbs' commands.<br><br></p>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>As of January 2023, the limit was <a href="https://circleci.com/changelog/#increase-in-config-compile-size-limit" target="_self">increased from 3MB to 4MB.</a></p>
<h2>Troubleshooting oversize config files</h2>
<p>To find out the size of the final <em>compiled</em> configuration, use the CircleCI CLI <a class="css-bspq7p" title="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/#processing-a-config" href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/how-to-use-the-circleci-local-cli#processing-a-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-renderer-mark="true">to process the original config</a>. From here, you can inspect the compiled configuration file using the commands below:<br><span class="prismjs css-14r4yet" data-code-lang="shell" data-ds--code--code-block=""></span></p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 5px;"><span class="">circleci config process .circleci/config.yml </span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class=""> compiled.yml<br></span><br>ls -lH <span class="">compiled.yml</span></pre>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="">Please note that the command below will fail if your compiled YAML file exceeds the 4MB limit.<br>These commands are meant to help you figure out if your current config is nearing the limit.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1">We have a <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/8258725964699-How-can-I-reduce-my-config-file-size-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collection of useful tips</a> to potentially reduce the size of the compiled config file.</p>
<p class="p1">If you choose to move your commands into scripts, you could also utilize <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/workflows/#using-workspaces-to-share-data-among-jobs" target="_self">workspaces</a> to copy external scripts between jobs, so you don't need to do a full checkout every time.</p>
