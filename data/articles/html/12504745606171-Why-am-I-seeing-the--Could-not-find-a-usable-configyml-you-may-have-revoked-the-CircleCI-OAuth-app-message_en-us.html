<h2 id="auth-fail">CircleCI cannot use the user's authentication to retrieve the config.yml file</h2>
<p>When you see that the pipeline does not run with the below error message, it means that the user, who triggered the build, could not be authenticated and therefore CircleCI could not retrieve the <span>configuration file</span> (config.yml). </p>
<p><code>Could not find a usable config.yml, you may have revoked the CircleCI OAuth app</code></p>
<p><span>When a user pushes a commit, opens a PR or triggers a new CircleCI build via the API or via the UI, CircleCI fetches the configuration file (config.yml)</span><span> to generate the pipeline. CircleCI will use the author's authentication token to fetch the config.yml file. When this authentication fails because the token has become invalid or has expired, the user will see the above error message.<br></span><span></span></p>
<h2 id="reauth-oauth"><span>Solution: Re-Authentication</span></h2>
<p>If this is the case, we recommend this user to re-authenticate with CircleCI.</p>
