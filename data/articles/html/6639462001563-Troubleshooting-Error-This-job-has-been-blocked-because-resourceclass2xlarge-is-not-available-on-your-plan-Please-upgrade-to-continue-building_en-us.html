<h1>Check Your Plan Information</h1>
<p>The first thing to check when encountered with this error is if your current plan allows for the use of 2xlarge resource classes in <a href="https://circleci.com/product/features/resource-classes/#Selecting-Resource-Classes:~:text=Selecting%20Resource%20Classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selecting Resource Classes</a>. If not, you will need to upgrade to a plan that includes this resource class. If your plan does include this resource class, contact your Customer Success Manager or file a ticket with <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CircleCI Support</a> to correct this error.</p>
