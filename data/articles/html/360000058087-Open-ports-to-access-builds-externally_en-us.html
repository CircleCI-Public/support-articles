<p>For security reasons, we do not allow external access to builds other than by SSH, and so it's not possible to modify ports for access. That said, you can still accomplish external access by using a third party paid service <a href="https://ngrok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as ngrok</a>, or by using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSH port forwarding</a> to make the port available to a machine that has SSH access to the build. </p>
