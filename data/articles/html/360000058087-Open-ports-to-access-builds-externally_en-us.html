<p>We do not allow external access to builds other than by SSH, and so it's not possible to modify ports for access.</p>
<p>You can still optionally access executors externally by using a third party paid service <a href="https://ngrok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as ngrok</a>, or by using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SSH port forwarding</a> to make the port available to a machine that has SSH access to the build.Â </p>
