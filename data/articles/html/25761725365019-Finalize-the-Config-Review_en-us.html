</h3>
<p>Document opportunities as they are found throughout the review. You will most likely find yourself referencing all sorts of documentation both internal and external in the review. Recording the links to those docs can be very helpful for anyone working on the changes after the review or who wants to understand why a certain recommendation was made.</p>

</h3>
<p>Test changes made by running a pipeline. After confirming the changes work on a dev branch, be sure to test them in different environments as well. Compare the new pipeline metrics to the metrics recorded in the config review to confirm changes were successful.</p>
<p>It is beneficial to monitor the changes after releasing them to confirm metrics don’t start going in the wrong direction unexpectedly.</p>
