</h3>
<p>Inspect the output of <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/caching/">caching steps</a> in <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#job">jobs</a> to ensure cache keys are regularly being found. If not, consider changing the cache key to be less specific or use a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/caching-strategy/#partial-dependency-caching-strategies">fallback key</a>.</p>
<p>For caching steps that are taking a long time, consider breaking up the cache into multiple caches. If the job is on the docker executor, consider enabling <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/using-docker/#ram-disks">RAM disk </a> to speed up I/O operations.</p>

<p>Ensure data being added to a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#workspace">workspace</a> is being used downstream and is accessible.</p>
<p>For workspace steps that are taking a long time, analyze the data for anything unnecessary. If the job is on the docker executor, consider enabling RAM disk to speed up I/O operations.</p>

</h3>
<p>Review how <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/artifacts/">artifacts</a> are used by the team that works in the project and see if adding or removing them would be helpful.</p>
<p>In most cases if artifacts are uploaded to cloud storage, like an s3 bucket, they do not also need to be stored in CircleCI.</p>

<p>Most organizations can benefit from reducing the default <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/persist-data">storage retention</a> periods without seeing impact, which can save some <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/credits/">credits</a>. The common recommendation is below but should be adjusted based on use case and user feedback.</p>
