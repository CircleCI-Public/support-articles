<p data-renderer-start-pos="8329"><span>If you see an error similar to the error shown below while using RedHat this is due to the launch agent executing the build agent being downloaded to a temporary directory which cannot be referenced due to noexec being turned on.</span></p>

<h2 data-renderer-start-pos="8424">Solution</h2>
<p dir="auto">To resolve this change the location of the temporary direction by setting the TMPDIR environment variable.</p>
<p dir="auto">The directory used for the build agent is changed by adding the following to<span></span><code>/etc/systemd/system/circleci.service</code> <span></span>(using /opt/circleci/tmp for example):</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>Environment=TMPDIR=/opt/circleci/tmp</code></p>
<p dir="auto">After making the addition, the file should resemble the following:</p>
<pre dir="ltr"><code>[Unit]
Description=CircleCI Runner
After=network.target
[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/circleci/circleci-launch-agent --config /opt/circleci/launch-agent-config.yaml
Environment=TMPDIR=/opt/circleci/tmp
Restart=always
User=root
NotifyAccess=exec
TimeoutStopSec=18300
[Install]
WantedBy = multi-user.target</code></pre>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="8602">Once this change has been made you should no longer see the issue and you should be able to build using runner.</p>
