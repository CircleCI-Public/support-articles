<h1>One Year Log Retention</h1>
<p>Similar to Audit Logs, CircleCI retains build logs for up to one year based on the repository name. As a result, logging back in and re-setting up a project will retain the logs. In order to keep logs for both projects separate, we recommend you increment your repository name, i.e. <strong>project</strong> to <strong>project-1</strong> or in a way that best suits your needs.</p>
<p><span>If you would like us to fully delete build logs associated with the project, please have an </span><a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034990033-Am-I-an-Org-Admin-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organization admin</a><span> contact us at <a href="https://support.circleci.com/">CircleCI Support</a></span><span> to fulfill this request.</span></p>
<p>If you would prefer to delete projects on your own rather than reaching out to Support, you can vote and comment and vote on an open feature request to support <a href="https://ideas.circleci.com/ideas/CCI-I-204" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project deletion in the UI</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Full project deletion is permanent and logs are unrecoverable once your request is complete.</p>
