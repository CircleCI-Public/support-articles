</h3>
<p><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/">Dynamic configuration</a> is an easy way to not have to run a full <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#pipeline">pipeline</a> when itâ€™s not needed, saving <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/credits/">credits</a> and time. Most projects can benefit from dynamic config but monolith <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project">projects</a> especially benefit.</p>

<p>Dynamic config has a wide variety of uses but essentially boils down to creating <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/pipeline-variables/#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration">pipeline parameters</a> in a setup workflow, then running <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#workflow">workflows</a> based off those parameters.</p>
<p>To start using dynamic config, CircleCI has an <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#orbs">orb</a> that creates parameters based on the paths in the repo where changes have been made. With a little bit of setup you can use the <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/path-filtering">path filtering orb</a> to not have to run your full workflow.</p>

<p>Review the pipeline and figure out what parameters could be created and used to trigger conditional workflows and jobs. Create a setup config that generates those parameters then uses the continuation orb to pass them to a downstream workflow.</p>
