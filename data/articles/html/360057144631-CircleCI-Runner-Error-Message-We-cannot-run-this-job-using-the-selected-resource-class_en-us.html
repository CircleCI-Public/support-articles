<h1>Error on Runner Install</h1>
<p>Customers may receive the following error when installing the CircleCI Runner:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><code>"We cannot run this job using the selected resource class. Please check your configuration and try again."</code></pre>
<p>If you have verified that the namespace and resource class have been created correctly, the issue may be that the CircleCI Runner is not enabled for your plan.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>You can verify that the namespace and resource class have been created correctly with the following command in the CircleCI CLI. Replace "namespace-name" with the name of your namespace. You should see your resource class listed in the response.</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><code>circleci runner resource-class list &lt;namespace-name&gt;</code></pre>
