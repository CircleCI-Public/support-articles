<h3 id="h_01HXED9YP9G44XYZEWS18AWERM">What is a Configuration Review</h3>
<p>A configuration review is a service, performed by our Field Engineers, where a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/glossary/#project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projectâ€™s pipeline</a> configuration is evaluated for improvement opportunities. Those opportunities are identified through the lens of goals created at the beginning of the review process.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HXEDA5QMEENXT0QTN2Y3Z27C">Why do a Configuration Review</h3>
<p>Config reviews are a key service for maintaining an optimized CI experience. The software you are building and the tools you are using are ever evolving so your pipelines should be evolving with them. Config reviews can help ensure the max value is extracted from every <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/credits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit</a>. Our Field Engineers have done hundreds of config reviews and have seen an equal number of use cases. Taking advantage of their knowledge not only saves you time, but also can help customize your pipelines.</p>
