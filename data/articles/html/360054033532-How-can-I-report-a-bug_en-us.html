<p>If you notice any issues with CircleCI you can <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit a support ticket</a>. In the support ticket, try to include any additional information that would help us triage the bug. For example: screenshots, steps to reproduce (if possible), and <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204410413-Generating-a-HAR-file-for-troubleshooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">producing HAR files</a> can help speed up identification and resolution of bugs.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HN18MNBTBBJ6MPWFK3ZN1263">Bug Bounties</h2>
<p>If you have found a bug in production, we hope you share this information with us to help improve the security of the broader Internet ecosystem.</p>
<p>CircleCI does <em>not</em> have a bug bounty program, and as such, does not issue bounties for bug reports. We do not offer payments or swag for reporting vulnerabilities.Â </p>
