<h1>Report an Issue to Support</h1>
<p>If you notice any issues with CircleCI you can <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit a support ticket</a>. In the support ticket, try to include any additional information that would help us triage the bug. For example: screenshots, steps to reproduce (if possible), and <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204410413-Generating-a-HAR-file-for-troubleshooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">producing HAR files</a> can help speed up identification and resolution of bugs.</p>
<h2>Bug Bounties</h2>
<p><span>If you have found a bug in production, we hope you share this information with us to help improve the security of the broader internet ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span>CircleCI does <em>not</em> have a bug bounty program, and as such, does not issue bounties for bug reports. We do not offer payments for reporting vulnerabilities. </span></p>
<p><span>In the event that a valuable novel discovery is uncovered, CircleCI agents may offer <strong>one</strong> bundle of swag as a reward at their discretion. We do not provide custom orders or fulfill specific requests. </span></p>
<h2>Feature Requests</h2>
<p>If you feel that a feature should work differently, or have suggestions for new features, you can <a href="https://ideas.circleci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">add them to our ideas page</a>. Our product teams regularly review the feedback and change requests.</p>
