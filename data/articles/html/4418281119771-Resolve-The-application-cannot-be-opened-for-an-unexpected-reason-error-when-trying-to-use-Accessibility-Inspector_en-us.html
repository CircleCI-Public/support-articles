<p>When trying to open the Accessibility Inspector on macOS builds, you may see the following error:</p>
<pre>The application cannot be opened for an unexpected reason, 
error=Error Domain=NSOSStatusErrorDomain Code=-10827 
"kLSNoExecutableErr: The executable is missing" UserInfo={_LSLine=3762,
_LSFunction=_LSOpenStuffCallLocal}
</pre>
<p>This can often be resolved by running the command again if it fails the first time:</p>
<pre><code>open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Accessibility\ Inspector.app || 
open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Applications/Accessibility\ Inspector.app
</code></pre>
