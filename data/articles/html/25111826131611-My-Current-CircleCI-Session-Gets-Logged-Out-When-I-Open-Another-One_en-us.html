<h1 id="h_01HW67HENEJHA2T6QH82HQCS84"><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
<p>Users may have noticed that recently, when opening another CircleCI session in another tab or window, you are logged out of the original tab or window.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="h_01HW67M2D8MT63SP21W29VVYNA"><strong>Why is This Happening?</strong></h2>
<p>This is considered expected behavior. We implemented this change to increase the security for our users and minimize any risk involved with having multiple sessions open at once.</p>
