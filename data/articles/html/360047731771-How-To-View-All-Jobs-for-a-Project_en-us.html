<h1>Legacy Jobs View</h1>
<p>At the moment in the <a href="https://circleci.com/blog/introducing-our-redesigned-UI-built-for-increased-user-productivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly redesigned UI</a> we provide a list of pipelines that have been run. Within these pipelines you will find the workflows that were run -- and the jobs associated with those workflows.</p>
<p>Occasionally you may be looking for a specific job run, or all currently running jobs for a project, you can still access this information via the "Legacy Jobs View".</p>
<p>This page can be accessed by tacking on <code style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">/jobs</code> to the end of the URL when viewing the pipelines for a project. As an example:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/(vcs)/(org)/(project)/jobs</pre>
<p> You should find a page like the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/360064761391/legacy_jobs.png" alt="legacy_jobs.png"></p>
<p>A note on this view though is it's mainly for informational purposes, you won't be able to take action against these running jobs (such as canceling or re-running them). To take those actions you will need to access the pipeline the job is associated with.</p>
