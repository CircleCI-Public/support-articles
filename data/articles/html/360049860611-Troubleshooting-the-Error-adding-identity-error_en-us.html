<p>The "We encountered a problem - Error adding identity ... The identity provided by your VCS service is already associated with a different account. Please try logging in using that account or contact us for further help." error typically occurs when the VCS account you are trying to connect has previously been authorized with CircleCI.</p>

<h2>Why Does This Happen?</h2>
<p class="p1">This error usually occurs when you have tried signing up through the GitHub or BitBucket account authorization option in the past, and then try to link that same GitHub/Bitbucket user to an account that was signed up via email.</p>
<p class="undefined">Another reason could be that your VCS account you are trying to link is already linked to another email authentication account.</p>
