<h1><span>How do you add contexts?</span></h1>
<p><span>Contexts provide a mechanism for securing and sharing environment variables across projects. </span>You can add contexts by clicking on <code>Organization Settings</code> &gt; <code>Contexts</code>.</p>
<p><span>Please note that you will need to be an admin or member of the organization to be able to create a context and you will need to be an admin to be able to restrict the context to a security team.</span></p>
<h2><span>You don't have permission to create a context.</span></h2>
<p><span>If you see the above error, this means that you either do not have sufficient permissions to add a context, or our system was not able to verify your permissions.</span></p>
<p><span>As a first step, please make sure that you are either a member with write permission or an admin of the organization on the VCS. </span><span>If you have the right permissions and still see the error, please go to <a href="https://app.circleci.com/settings/user" target="_blank" rel="noopener">your user settings</a> and click on `Refresh permissions`.</span></p>
<p><span>If the error persists after refreshing your permissions, it is possible that your OAuth token has expired or became invalid.
