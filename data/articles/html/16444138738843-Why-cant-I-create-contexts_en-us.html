<h1 id="h_01HN3GK3P5JDM3P8V48DXM6SZG">How do you add contexts?</h1>
<p>Contexts provide a mechanism for securing and sharing environment variables across projects. You can add contexts by clicking on <code>Organization Settings</code> &gt; <code>Contexts</code>.</p>
<p>Please note that you will need to be an admin or member of the organization to be able to create a context and you will need to be an admin to be able to restrict the context to a security team.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HN3GK3P5ARXW4ZZC55YXJKB1">You don't have permission to create a context.</h2>
<p>If you see the above error, this means that you either do not have sufficient permissions to add a context, or our system was not able to verify your permissions.</p>
<p>As a first step, please make sure that you are either a member with write permission or an admin of the organization on the VCS. If you have the right permissions and still see the error, please go to <a href="https://app.circleci.com/settings/user" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">your user settings</a> and click on "Refresh permissions".</p>
<p>If the error persists after refreshing your permissions, it is possible that your OAuth token has expired or became invalid.
