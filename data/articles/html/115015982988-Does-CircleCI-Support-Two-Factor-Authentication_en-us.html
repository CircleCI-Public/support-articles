<h1>Enable 2FA for VCS</h1>
<p>CircleCI does not have its own user model for now. We allow users to log in using their GitHub or Bitbucket. If you wish to enable two-factor authentication (2FA), you should do so from within the account that you use to sign in to CircleCI. </p>
<p>Instructions for the platforms can be found below: </p>
