<p>If you see something like this on CircleCI builds when using two docker images:</p>
<p><code>/bin/bash: {name_of_command}: command not found</code></p>
<p>Below is example `config.yml` file that uses `circleci/python:3.6.4` as primary image and `circleci/postgres:9.6.2` as an additional image that will run in a separate<span> container with the DB service being available via port </span><code>27017</code><span> (or whatever port you want to use) in the primary container.</span></p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">version: 2.1

  slack: circleci/slack@4.0.0

jobs:
  build:
    working_directory: ~/circleci-demo-python-django
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.6.4
        environment:
          PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT: true
          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://root@localhost/circle_test?sslmode=disable
      - image: circleci/postgres:9.6.2
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: root
          POSTGRES_DB: circle_test  
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run: postgres -V</pre>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is because all of your commands will run in the first container that is listed (primary container). This is typically <strong>not</strong> the database container, which means that the <code>postgres</code> cli is likely not installed in the primary container. The same can happen for mysql and mongo.</p>
<p>In these cases you can install the client using <code>sudo pip install</code> or the relevant package manager for the distro your image is running.</p>
<p>example:</p>
<pre>- run: sudo pip install postgressql</pre>
