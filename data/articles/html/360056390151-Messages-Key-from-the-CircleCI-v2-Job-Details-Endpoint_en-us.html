<h2>Messages Key</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/getJobDetails" target="_self">Get Job Details endpoint</a> contains a <code>messages</code> key and you may wonder what sort of information should be present there.</p>
<p>This key will provide error messages related to the build not running. It will return an empty array on both passing builds and builds that failed while running.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This build didn't run:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/360084559911/Screen_Shot_2021-01-22_at_9.06.57_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2021-01-22_at_9.06.57_AM.png"></p>
<p>This is what would be returned from the API:</p>
<pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">"messages" : [ {
    "type" : "warning",
    "reason" : "no-followers",
    "message" : "Your build was not run - reason code (no-followers)."
  }, {
    "type" : "error",
    "message" : "We did not test this push because nobody is following the project"
  } ],</pre>
