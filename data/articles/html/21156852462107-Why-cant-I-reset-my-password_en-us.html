<p>If you are unable to log with email and password and a password reset email isn't coming through, you might actually have an account through Bitbucket or GitHub OAuth. Please navigate to <a href="https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize">https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize</a>. You should see an option drop down that says "Signed up with GitHub or Bitbucket before September 2023?" which will allow you to log in with your VCS information.</p>
<p>If you still have problems logging in, please reach out via our<a href="https://support.circleci.com/"> Support Portal</a>.</p>
