<p>It is best to use <a href="https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/slack" target="_self">CircleCI's Slack Orb</a> to easily integrate custom Slack notifications into your CircleCI projects. </p>
<p>The Orb allows users to create custom alert messages for any job or receive status updates. </p>
<p>There are examples of code snippets that can be used as part of a workflow and all of the code that makes up the orb can be found at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Note: There are old integrations of Slack that are no longer supported by CircleCI. This is often time why users are not receiving Slack Notifications.</p>
