<h2 id="h_01HE2KZ4GBW34ENC4437HDFJWN">Overview</h2>
<p>This article addresses an issue where a Pull Request (PR) gets merged prematurely while CircleCI triggers another workflow. This situation often arises when using dynamic configuration, which initiates a "setup" job to determine the changed files and triggers code tests based on those changes. The problem occurs when the "setup" job completion is interpreted as a "passed" status check, causing the merge queue to merge the PR even before the actual tests are triggered.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Enabled <a href="https://github.blog/2023-07-12-github-merge-queue-is-generally-available/">merge queues</a> in GitHub. </li>
    <li>Dynamic configuration usage CircleCI</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01HE2MASXABEE7YM4MW5Z0VZNQ">Solution</h2>
<p>To resolve this issue, you can configure the timeout of the Status Check on Github. This adjustment allows CircleCI to allocate some time for the next workflow to run. The <strong>Status Check timeout</strong> determines how long the queue should wait for a response from CI before assuming that checks have failed. </p>
<p>As mentioned in the Github documentation:</p>
