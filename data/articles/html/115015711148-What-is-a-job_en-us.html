<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/jobs-steps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job</a> is a collection of <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#steps" target="_self">steps</a> that are <span>executed as a single unit</span> in an execution environment. Jobs are defined in your <code>config.yml</code>.</p>
<h2>What makes a job</h2>
<p>At the very minimum, your job needs to have <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an executor</a> defined, and at least one step.</p>
<p>Typically your job will first <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out your repository</a> using the special <code>checkout</code> step. Then, using <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#run" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run steps</a>, you can execute bash commands to perform your building, testing, and deployments.</p>
<p><a href="https://circleci.com/docs/workflows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Using workflows</a>, you can define multiple jobs that run in a <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/workflows#sequential-job-execution-example" target="_blank" rel="noopener">specific sequence</a>, in parallel, and <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/workflows#fan-outfan-in-workflow-example" target="_blank" rel="noopener">various other configurations</a>. </p>
<h2>Boost your config</h2>
<p>There are a whole lot of special steps that you can use to speed up your jobs or add other functionality to your build process.</p>
<p>You can try <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#save_cache" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using cached dependencies</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#store_artifacts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saving artifacts </a>you have created in your jobs, or even <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#storetestresults" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saving your test reports</a> to see how your tests performed right on the job page UI.</p>
<p>While you are waiting for your jobs to complete, take a scroll through all of the configuration features <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on our docs page</a>.</p>
