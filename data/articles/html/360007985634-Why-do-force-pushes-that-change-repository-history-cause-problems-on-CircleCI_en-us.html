<p>Sometimes you may need to revise the history of your git repository and force push these changes to your VCS provider.</p>
<p>While sometimes it's required, making force pushes a common part of your workflow can potentially cause issues when running jobs on CircleCI.</p>
<p>If you run many jobs on CircleCI, while also changing the repository history often, you will notice jobs may fail due to unknown object references being requested during the checkout phase.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is because VCS providers handle these types of updates differently and the changes are not always reflected across all services immediately.</p>
<p>For instance, the force push can trigger a job, but the webhook we receive might be for an old commit hash rather than the new one that was part of the force push.</p>
<p>By the time your job runs, it pulls the most recent code and fails because it cannot find the old commit hash in the new repo history. </p>
<p>Also, consider the case for a team that runs many jobs and large workflows. Someone on your team may push a commit that triggers a workflow with many jobs.</p>
<p>Some of the jobs in the workflow may not start for hours yet still rely on data from the webhook hours ago.</p>
<p>If someone forces a push that changes the repository history it will cause later jobs that run checkout to have the wrong commit reference than what triggered the original workflow.</p>
<p>The becomes especially problematic when you have any jobs queued and someone forces an update.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These issues can be avoided by limiting force pushes as much as possible and making sure jobs/workflows aren't being triggered during these types of push events.</p>
