<p>Images based on the Arm architecture, such as <span>Raspberry Pi</span> images, need to be built using the Arm resources rather than the default x86_64 resources that the Docker executor uses. This is because different binaries are required for different platforms.</p>
<h2 data-renderer-start-pos="7432">Solutions:</h2>
<ul class="ak-ul" data-indent-level="1">
    <li>
        <p data-renderer-start-pos="7446">Add resource_class: arm.medium to your executor</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p data-renderer-start-pos="7610">You should now be able to build on arm.</p>
