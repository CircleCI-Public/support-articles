<h1>Enable SSH on a Machine Runner</h1>
<p>In some cases, you may wish to run your runner with SSH for debugging purposes. </p>
<p>This is possible via your <code>launch-agent-config.yml</code></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Step 1 - Considerations before enabling SSH debugging</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
    <p>Task-agent runs an embedded SSH server and agent on a dedicated port when the “Rerun job with SSH” option is activated. This feature will not affect any other SSH servers or agents on the system that the self-hosted runner is installed on.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The host port used by the SSH server is currently fixed to<span> </span><code class="language-none" data-testid="code-snippet-highlight">54782</code>. Ensure this port is unblocked and available for SSH connections. A port conflict can occur if multiple machine runners are installed on the same host.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The SSH server will inherit the same user privileges and associated access authorizations as the task-agent, defined by the<span> </span><span><a class="css-x7gnkn" href="https://circleci.com/docs/runner-config-reference/#runner-command_prefix" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-testid="link">runner.command_prefix parameter</a></span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The SSH server is configured for public key authentication. Anyone with permission to initiate a job can rerun it with SSH. However, only the user who initiated the rerun will have their SSH public keys added to the server for the duration of the SSH session.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Rerunning a job with SSH will hold the job open for<span> </span><strong>two hours</strong><span> </span>if a connection is made to the SSH server, or<span> </span><strong>ten minutes</strong><span> </span>if no connection is made, unless canceled. While in this state, the job is counted against an organization’s concurrency limit, and the task-agent will be unavailable to handle other jobs. Therefore, it is recommended to cancel an SSH rerun job explicitly (through the web UI or CLI) when finished debugging.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step 2 - Add the flag to your <code>launch-agent-config.yml</code>
    </h2>
    <p>To add the flag to your <code>launch-agent-config.yml</code>, you can do the following:</p>
    <pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 5px;" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">api: <br>  auth_token: AUTH_TOKEN <br>runner: <br>  name: RUNNER_NAME<br>  ssh:<br>    advertise_addr: HOSTNAME:54782</pre>
    <p><span>Where <code>HOSTNAME</code> would need to be set to an IP or Hostname that is reachable from where you would like to SSH from.</span></p>
