<p>One major cause of this is using Docker Layer Caching when your image has many layers, you're caching many images, or a combination of both. The more cached layers/images you have the longer it will take to start remote docker.</p>
<p>To mitigate this you can try reducing the number of layers in your image, or separate building images into multiple jobs using <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/">workflows</a>.Â </p>
