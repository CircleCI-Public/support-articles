<h1>Permission From Owner</h1>
<p>When forking a private repository to another organization, the repository will not show up on the projects list for the downstream organization unless the original organization grants permission to the  CircleCI OAuth application on GitHub.</p>
<p>As a workaround, you can recreate the repository under your organization. However, this will not allow you to pull down new changes from the original repository as it is not a fork.</p>
