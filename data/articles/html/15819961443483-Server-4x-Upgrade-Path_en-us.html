<h1 id="h_01HBV4BMSDSXE8EBN9NJK4P0MS">Overview</h1>
<p>When CircleCI releases new Server versions your team may want to upgrade to the latest release which might introduce some changes that your team were looking forwarding to implementing in your server environment. With the minor and patch versions receiving somewhat frequent updates, it can be less than clear on the optimal upgrade path.</p>
<p>When upgrading your CircleCI Server, you cannot skip any <strong>minor</strong> releases as there may be migrations that need to be done. When you are on an x.x.0 <strong>patch</strong> release, you may skip to the latest patch release of that same <strong>minor</strong> version.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="h_01HBV4BMSDMHV61BSKBFHT7TZR">Upgrading your Version and Suggested Upgrade Examples</h2>
<p>The path taken for upgrading is dependent on both the currently available versions and releases as well as the current version your team's cluster is on. Some popular upgrade paths can be found below:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="h_01HBV4BMSD8EM4AJMX1C82BGEB">Examples</h3>
<p><strong>From Server <code>4.0.1</code> to <code>4.1.5</code></strong></p>
<pre><code>4.0.1 &gt; 4.0.5 &gt; 4.1.0 &gt; 4.1.5</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li>While the <code>4.0.2</code> and <code>4.0.3</code> patches can be skipped, it is recommended to stop at the last patch <code>4.0.5</code> before the next minor version (i.e. <code>4.1.0</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>From Server <code>4.0.4</code> to <code>4.1.3</code></strong></p>
<pre><code> 4.0.5 &gt; 4.1.0 &gt; 4.1.5</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li>Since this is the latest patch for <code>4.0.x</code>, it can be upgraded right to <code>4.1.0</code> before moving onto to <code>4.1.5</code>
    </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>From Server <code>4.1.0</code> to <code>4.1.5</code></strong></p>
<pre><code>4.1.0 &gt; 4.1.5</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li>When upgrading from <code>4.1.0</code> release to the latest patch release, <code>4.1.1</code> and <code>4.1.2</code> can be skipped by upgrading to the latest patch of <code>4.1.x</code>
    </li>
</ul>
