<ul>
    <li>The projects in this section are not idle or planned but are actively being worked on.</li>
    <li>Just because a feature is listed under "Now" does not necessarily mean there is a confirmed release date for it. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01HX0A70DF83EA0S199VDMGVH3">Next</h2>
<p>The <strong>Next column</strong> represents features and improvements that are in the discovery phase, meaning they are being studied and prepared for active development.</p>

    <li>It is important to note that being listed in the "Future" column <strong>does not guarantee</strong> that a feature or improvement will be acted upon.</li>
